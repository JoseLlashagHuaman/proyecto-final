Often,\\nmeasures of performance are the criteria used to determine the effectiveness of an employee testing or screening\\nprogram as discussed in the previous chapter. Because job performance is such an important outcome variable\\nin I/O psychology, it is important to understand the measurement issues concerning this factor. For example,\\nwhen reviewing studies that discuss influences on job performance, you should investigate how performance\\nwas operationally defined and measured. Were objective or subjective criteria used? How accurate or inaccurate\\nmight the assessments of performance be? How can performance assessments and appraisals be improved?\\nJob Performance and Performance Appraisals\\nFrom the first few days on the job, you have wondered, “How am I doing?” Are you performing at an\\nacceptable (or better) level? How are you performing in comparison to others in a similar position or compared\\nto what your supervisor expects? You wait for some assessment of your job performance with a mixture of\\neager anticipation and trepidation.\\nThe evaluation of employees’ job performance is a vital personnel function and of critical importance to the\\norganization. In this chapter, we will consider the very important variable of job performance in the context of\\nassessments and evaluations. We will discuss the importance of performance appraisals, procedures for\\nappraising performance, and the difficulties encountered in attempting to appraise performance. \\nWe will also\\nlook at research on performance appraisals and assessment and discuss the legal concerns in performance\\nappraisals.\\nIt is important to note, as we saw in \\nChapter 4\\n, that the measurement of job performance serves as our\\ncriterion measure to determine if employee screening and selection procedures are working. In other words, by\\nassessing new workers’ performance at some point after they are hired, organizations can determine if the\\npredictors of job performance do indeed predict success on the job. Measurement of performance is also\\nimportant in determining the effectiveness of employee training programs, as we will see in \\nChapter 7\\n. In\\naddition to training programs, performance assessments can serve as a basis for evaluating the effectiveness of\\nother organizational programs or changes, such as changes in work design or systems, supervisors, or working\\nconditions.\\nIn work organizations, measurement of performance typically takes place in the context of formalized\\nperformance appraisals\\n, which measure worker performance in comparison to certain predetermined\\nstandards. Performance appraisals serve many purposes for the individual worker, for the worker’s supervisor,\\nand for the organization as a whole (Cleveland, Murphy, & Williams, 1989).\\nPerformance Appraisals\\n the formalized means of assessing worker performance in comparison to certain\\nestablished organizational standards\\nFor the worker, performance appraisals are linked to career advancement.

Research has shown that employees who receive regular performance appraisals that\\nare characterized as “helpful” to the performance of their job show stronger commitment to their jobs and\\norganizations (Kuvaas, 2011).

       " Document(page_content='Objective Performance Criteria\\n measures of job performance that are easily quantified\\nOne important categorization of job performance assessments is to distinguish between objective and\\nsubjective measures. Objective and subjective performance criteria are also sometimes referred to as “hard” and\\n“soft” performance criteria, respectively (Smith, 1976; Viswesvaran, 2001). \\nObjective performance criteria\\ninvolve the measurement of some easily quantifiable aspects of job performance, such as the number of units\\nproduced, the dollar amount of sales, or the time needed to process some information. For example, an\\nobjective criterion for an assembly-line worker might be the number of products assembled. For an insurance\\nclaims adjuster, the average amount of time it takes to process a claim might be an objective measure of\\nperformance (see \\nTable 6.2\\n). Such criteria are often referred to as measures of productivity.\\nSubjective Performance Criteria\\n measures of job performance that typically consist of ratings or\\njudgments of performance\\nSubjective performance criteria\\n consist of judgments or ratings made by some knowledgeable individual,\\nsuch as a worker’s supervisor or coworker. These criteria are often used when objective criteria are\\nunavailable, difficult to assess, or inappropriate. For example, it is usually inappropriate to use objective\\nperformance criteria to assess a manager’s job because it is difficult to specify the exact behaviors that\\nindicate successful managerial performance. Instead subjective criteria, such as subordinate or superior ratings,\\nare used.\\nTable 6.2\\n Examples of Objective Job Performance Criteria\\nJob Title\\nMeasure\\nSocial worker\\nNumber of clients helped, number of people diagnosed\\nReal estate agent\\nNumber of houses sold\\nCustomer service (telephone)\\nNumber of people helped, number of complaints received\\nCashier\\nNumber of products purchased, people helped\\nHotel maid\\nNumber of rooms cleaned, towels replaced\\nTruck driver\\nMiles driven, weight of cargo carried, amount of time taken per trip\\nAircraft maintenance worker\\nNumber of planes serviced\\nReceptionist\\nNumber of people checked in, appointments scheduled\\nCabinet worker\\nNumber of cabinets made\\nFast-food cook\\nNumber of burgers cooked, amount of time to cook burger\\nBartender\\nNumber of drinks served, amount of tips given\\nBill collector\\nAmount of debt collected, number of people contacted\\nHair stylist\\nNumber of haircuts given\\nPharmacy technician\\nNumber of prescriptions filled\\nTelemarketer\\nNumber of people called, number of rejections received\\nSource\\n: Adapted from The measurement of work performance: Methods, theory, and applications by F.

First, because objective criteria typically involve\\ncounts of output or the timing of tasks, they are less prone to bias and distortion than subjective performance\\nratings. Second, objective criteria are usually more directly tied to “bottom-line” assessments of an\\norganization’s success, such as the number of products assembled or dollar sales figures. It is often more\\ndifficult to determine the links between subjective criteria and bottom-line outcomes.\\n142', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 141}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=' \\nStop \\n&\\n Review\\nDescribe nine purposes of performance appraisals.\\nAs mentioned, it is often difficult, if not impossible, to obtain objective performance criteria for certain jobs,\\nsuch as graphic artist, software developer, and executive vice president. Jobs such as these may best be assessed\\nthrough ratings or judgments. Another drawback of objective assessments is that they may focus too much on\\nspecific, quantifiable outcomes. Because many jobs are complex, looking at only one or two objective measures\\nof performance may not capture the total picture of performance. Some aspects of job performance such as\\nwork quality, worker initiative, and work effort are difficult to assess objectively. For example, a salesperson\\nmight have high dollar sales figures, but may be so pushy and manipulative that customers are unlikely to\\nreturn to the store. Likewise, a research analyst may have relatively low output rates because he spends a great\\ndeal of time teaching new workers valuable work techniques and helping coworkers solve problems. It is\\nimportant to emphasize that comprehensive evaluation of employee performance might include \\nboth very\\npositive, outside-of-the-job-description activities, such as helping other workers, and counterproductive\\nbehaviors, such as “goofing off,” substance abuse on the job, or disrupting the work team (Viswesvaran &\\nOnes, 2000).\\nIn many cases, collecting objective performance data is time consuming and costly (although see “On the\\nCutting Edge”). By contrast, subjective performance criteria are usually easy and relatively inexpensive to\\nobtain and thus may be the preferred method of assessment for many organizations. Moreover, subjective\\nperformance criteria can be used to assess variables that could not be measured objectively, such as employee\\nmotivation or “team spirit.”\\nRegardless of the criteria used to evaluate performance of a job, a number of important criterion concerns or\\nissues have implications for conducting accurate performance appraisals (Bernardin & Beatty, 1984). A primary\\nissue is whether the criteria identified in the job analysis relate to the true nature of the job. A particular\\nconcern here is \\ncriterion relevance\\n: the notion that the means of appraising performance is indeed pertinent\\nto job success, as identified in the job analysis. A performance appraisal should cover only the specific KSAOs\\nneeded to perform a job successfully. For example, the performance criteria for a bookkeeper should deal with\\nknowledge of accounting procedures, mathematical skills, and producing work that is neat and error free, not\\nwith personal appearance or oral communication skills—factors that are clearly not relevant to the effective\\nperformance of a bookkeeper’s job. However, for a public relations representative, personal appearance and\\ncommunication skills may be relevant performance criteria.\\nCriterion Relevance\\n the extent to which the means of appraising performance is pertinent to job success\\nOn the \\nCutting\\n Edge\\nThe Boss Is Watching: Electronic Monitoring of Employee Performance\\n“Your call may be monitored in an effort to improve our customer service.” How many times have you\\nheard that when calling a helpline? Probably most of the time. Workers in call centers, as well as many\\nemployees who work online or on company computer networks, can have their performance monitored\\nelectronically. For example, employees in the collections department of a credit card company must\\nmaintain computerized records of phone calls, correspondence, and other activity for all accounts. The\\ncomputerized monitoring system allows supervisors to note the number and length of calls to each\\naccount, as well as the amount of money collected. Supervisors receive a detailed weekly report of\\nemployee computer activities that give a good indication of how the workers spent their time. A hard\\nmeasure of employee performance is obtained from the amount of money collected from each account.\\n143', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 142}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Estimates are that about 80% of employers use some sort of electronic surveillance of employee\\nperformance (Alge, 2001).\\nAlthough electronic performance monitoring can lead to more objective assessments of employee\\nperformance, workers have raised certain objections. Some have argued that computer monitoring\\nfocuses only on those behaviors that are easily quantified, such as time engaged in a particular activity or\\ndollar sales figures, but ignores measures of quality (Brewer & Ridgway, 1998). \\nAnother important\\nconsideration is the protection of employees’ rights to privacy (Ambrose, Alder, & Noel, 1998). There is\\nsome question as to when employer monitoring of work activities begins to infringe on the employees’\\nfreedom to conduct work activities in a manner they see fit (Chalykoff & Kochan, 1989; Zweig & Scott,\\n2007; Zweig & Webster, 2002). Another concern is whether employees view electronic monitoring as\\nbeing a “fair” supervisory practice (McNall & Roch, 2009). A related problem is that employee creativity\\nand innovation in work methods may be stifled if the workers know that work activities are being\\nmonitored.\\nResearch has investigated the effects of computerized monitoring on employee performance with\\ncontrolled experiments (e.g., Aiello & Kolb, 1995; Stanton & Barnes-Farrell, 1996; Stanton & Julian, 2002).\\nMuch of this research suggests that giving employees feedback about the performance monitoring and\\nallowing workers a “voice” in the performance monitoring program by having workers participate in\\nsetting their performance goals alleviates many of the “negatives” associated with computerized\\nmonitoring (Ambrose & Alder, 2000; Nebeker & Tatum, 1993). In any case, computerized monitoring is\\nhere to stay and, as systems become more sophisticated, is likely to increase even more in the future. The\\nchallenge for I/O psychologists is to understand the effects of electronic performance monitoring on\\nemployees’ behaviors, motivation, and satisfaction with the job and organization (Stanton, 2000).\\nA related concern is \\ncriterion contamination\\n: the extent to which performance appraisals contain elements\\nthat detract from the accurate assessment of job effectiveness—elements that should not be included in the\\nperformance assessment. A common source of criterion contamination stems from appraiser biases. For\\nexample, a supervisor may give an employee an overly positive performance appraisal because the employee\\nhas a reputation of past work success or because the employee was a graduate of a prestigious university.\\nCriterion contamination can also result from extraneous factors that contribute to a worker’s apparent success\\nor failure in a job. For instance, a sales manager may receive a poor performance appraisal because of low sales\\nlevels, even though the poor sales actually result from the fact that the manager supervises a young,\\ninexperienced sales force.\\nCriterion Contamination\\n the extent to which performance appraisals contain elements that detract from\\nthe accurate assessment of job effectiveness\\nIt is unlikely that any criterion will capture job performance perfectly; every criterion of job performance\\nmay fall short of measuring performance to some extent. \\nCriterion deficiency\\n describes the degree to which a\\ncriterion falls short of measuring job performance perfectly. Criterion deficiency occurs when the\\nmeasurement of the performance criteria is incomplete. An important goal of performance appraisals is to\\nchoose criteria that optimize the assessment of job success, thereby keeping criterion deficiency to a minimum.\\nCriterion Deficiency\\n the degree to which a criterion falls short of measuring job performance\\nA final concern is \\ncriterion usefulness\\n, or the extent to which a performance criterion is usable in\\nappraising a particular job in an organization.

Before we examine\\nthe various methods of rating job performance, we need to consider who is doing the rating. In the vast\\nmajority of cases, it is the immediate supervisor who rates the performance of direct reports (Jacobs, 1986).\\nHowever, performance appraisals can also be made by a worker’s peers, by subordinates, by the worker\\nhimself or herself, or even by customers evaluating the performance of a service worker. The obvious\\nadvantage of getting these different perspectives on performance assessment is that each type of appraiser—\\nsupervisor, self, peer, subordinate, and customer—may see a different aspect of the worker’s performance and\\nthus may offer unique perspectives (Conway, Lombardo, & Sanders, 2001). Moreover, multiple-perspective\\nperformance appraisals can have increased reliability (there are more raters evaluating the same performance\\nbehaviors) and an increased sense of fairness and greater acceptance by the worker being evaluated (Harris &\\nSchaubroeck, 1988).\\nSupervisor Appraisals\\nBy far, most performance appraisals are performed by supervisors. In fact, conducting regular appraisals of\\nemployee performance is considered one of the most important supervisory functions. Supervisor performance\\nappraisals are so common because supervisors are usually quite knowledgeable about the job requirements, are\\noften in a position to provide rewards for effective performance (and suggestions for improvement for\\nsubstandard performance), and typically have a great deal of contact with supervisees. This is probably why\\nresearch has consistently demonstrated that supervisory ratings have higher reliability than either peer or\\nsubordinate ratings of performance (Viswesvaran, Ones, & Schmidt, 1996). In addition, the test–retest\\nreliability of supervisor ratings is quite high (Salgado, Moscoso, & Lado, 2003). Still, supervisors may have a\\nlimited perspective on employees’ performance, so in addition to supervisor appraisals, other organizational\\nmember appraisals are important.\\nSelf-Appraisals\\nSelf-appraisals of performance have been used by many companies, usually in conjunction with supervisor\\nappraisals. Although there is evidence that self-appraisals correlate slightly with supervisor performance\\nappraisals, self-appraisals tend to be more lenient and focus more on effort exerted rather than on performance\\naccomplishments (Heidemeier & Moser, 2009; Wohlers, Hall, & London, 1993; Wohlers & London, 1989). Quite\\noften, there are large discrepancies between how supervisors rate performance and the worker’s self-rating\\n(Furnham & Stringfield, 1994). It has been suggested that part of the discrepancy between self- and supervisor\\nappraisals can be overcome if both the worker and the supervisor are thoroughly trained to understand how\\nthe performance rating system works (Schrader & Steiner, 1996; Williams & Levy, 1992) and when workers\\n145', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 144}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='receive more frequent, regular performance feedback from supervisors (Williams & Johnson, 2000). One\\nadvantage of appraisal discrepancies, however, may be that they highlight differences in supervisor and worker\\nperceptions and can lead to an open dialogue between supervisor and supervisee (Campbell & Lee, 1988). Self-\\nappraisals of performance are also useful in encouraging workers to be more committed to performance-related\\ngoals (Riggio & Cole, 1992).\\nFigure 6.1\\n How would the performance of this artisan best be assessed?\\nSource:\\n marcovarro/Shutterstock\\nAlthough studies of U.S. workers have found that self-appraisals tend to be more lenient than supervisor\\nperformance ratings, a study of Chinese workers found that their appraisals showed a “modesty bias.” That is,\\nChinese workers gave themselves lower ratings of job performance than did their supervisors (Farh, Dobbins,\\n& Cheng, 1991). This may also occur in other countries and cultures where employees are less “self-oriented”\\nthan Americans (Barron & Sackett, 2008; Korsgaard, Meglino, & Lester, 2004). In comparison to U.S. workers,\\nthe self-appraisals of Chinese workers were substantially lower on average, indicating that the accuracy of self-\\nappraisals and their discrepancy from supervisor ratings may need to be evaluated with culture taken into\\naccount.\\nPeer Appraisals\\nAlthough once rare, the use of peer ratings of performance is on the rise (Dierdorff & Surface, 2007). Research\\nevidence indicates that there is good agreement between performance ratings made by peers and those made\\nby supervisors (Conway & Huffcutt, 1996; Harris & Schaubroeck, 1988; Vance, MacCallum, Coovert, & Hedge,\\n1988). This makes sense because both supervisors and peers have the opportunity to directly observe workers\\non the job. One obvious problem with peer ratings of performance is the potential for conflict among\\nemployees who are evaluating each other, a particular problem when peers are competing for scarce job\\nrewards (DeNisi, Randolph, & Blencoe, 1983; McEvoy & Buller, 1987).\\nWith the increased emphasis on coordinated work teams, peer appraisals of performance may be of greater\\nimportance now and in the future. We will consider team performance appraisals in depth later in this chapter.\\n146', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 145}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Moreover, research shows that supervisors tend to give some weight to peer appraisals and will incorporate\\nthem into their own supervisory appraisals (Makiney & Levy, 1997).\\n \\nStop \\n&\\n Review\\nDefine four important criterion concerns in performance appraisals.\\nSubordinate Appraisals\\nSubordinate ratings are most commonly used to assess the effectiveness of persons in supervisory or leadership\\npositions. Research on subordinate appraisals indicates considerable agreement with supervisor ratings (Mount,\\n1984; Riggio & Cole, 1992). Subordinate ratings may be particularly important because they provide a different,\\nmeaningful perspective on a supervisor’s performance—the perspective of the persons being supervised—and\\nbecause there is evidence that ratings of supervisors may be associated with subordinate job satisfaction.\\nImportantly, a meta-analysis demonstrated that both subordinate and peer ratings of performance correlated\\nsignificantly with objective measures of job performance (Conway et al., 2001).\\nIn general, supervisors and managers have been found to support the use of subordinate appraisals. In one\\nstudy, it was found that supervisors were supportive of \\nsubordinate appraisals as a useful and positive source\\nof data, except in situations when they are used as a basis for determining salary (Bernardin, Dahmus, &\\nRedmon, 1993). The most positive attitudes expressed toward subordinate appraisals were from supervisory\\nemployees who received appraisal feedback from both subordinates and supervisors at the same time. Attitudes\\ntoward the use of subordinate appraisals were less positive and more cautious, however, when subordinate\\nappraisal feedback was given to supervisors with no other sources of appraisal data. More recently, it was\\nfound that supervisors who discussed the ratings with their direct reports improved their performance more\\nthan supervisors who did not discuss the feedback with supervisees (Walker & Smither, 1999). Thus, these\\nfindings suggest that how subordinate appraisals are used influences their effectiveness.\\nCustomer Appraisals\\nAnother form of performance rating for employees working in customer service positions is ratings made by\\ncustomers. Although customer ratings are not commonly considered a method of performance appraisal, they\\ncan be because they offer an interesting perspective on whether certain types of workers (salespersons,\\nwaitpersons, telephone operators) are doing a good job. Customer evaluations of an individual employee’s\\nperformance are most appropriate when the employee and customer have a significant, ongoing relationship,\\nsuch as customers evaluating a supplier, a sales representative, a real estate agent, a stockbroker, or the like.\\nInterestingly, there is evidence that organizations that strongly encourage customer service and those that train\\ntheir employees in customer service delivery tend to receive more favorable evaluations from customers\\n(Johnson, 1996; Schneider & Bowen, 1995).\\n360-Degree Feedback\\n360-Degree Feedback\\n a method of gathering performance appraisals from a worker’s supervisors,\\nsubordinates, peers, customers, and other relevant parties\\nA comprehensive form of performance appraisal gathers ratings from all levels in what is commonly called\\n360-degree feedback\\n (London & Beatty, 1993; Waldman, Atwater, & Antonioni, 1998). In 360-degree feedback\\n147', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 146}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='programs (sometimes referred to as multirater feedback), performance ratings are gathered from supervisors,\\nsubordinates, peers, customers, and suppliers (if applicable). The obvious advantages of 360-degree feedback\\ninclude improved reliability of measurement because of the multiple evaluations, the inclusion of more diverse\\nperspectives on the employee’s performance, the involvement of more organizational members in the\\nevaluation and feedback process, and improved organizational communication (Campion, Campion, &\\nCampion, 2015). Although 360-degree feedback programs may have distinct advantages, including enhanced\\ndevelopment and improved performance of employees (Fletcher, 2015; London & Smither, 1995), \\nthe costs of\\nsuch detailed assessments of worker performance may be prohibitive. In addition, there have been calls for\\nmore research to demonstrate the advantages of 360-degree evaluations over less comprehensive and costly\\nperformance appraisal programs (Borman, 1998; Dunnette, 1993; Greguras & Robie, 1997). Recent research has\\nalso suggested that there may be cultural differences in how employees are rated by others, so multirater\\nsystems may yield different results in different countries or cultures (Eckert, Ekelund, Gentry, & Dawson, 2010;\\nNowack & Mashihi, 2012).\\nFor the most part, 360-degree feedback programs are being used as a management development tool, rather\\nthan being used only as a performance appraisal system. Therefore, we will discuss 360-degree feedback more\\nfully in the next chapter on employee training.\\nMethods of Rating Performance\\nWhen it comes to subjectively evaluating employee performance, a variety of rating methods can be used. We\\nwill review some of the more common methods. These methods can be classified into two general categories:\\nthose that can be termed “comparative methods” and those that can be labeled “individual methods.”\\nComparative Methods\\nComparative methods\\n of performance appraisal involve some form of comparison of one worker’s\\nperformance with the performance of others. These procedures are relatively easy to implement in work\\norganizations and include \\nrankings\\n, \\npaired comparisons\\n, and \\nforced distributions\\n.\\nComparative Methods\\n performance appraisal methods involving comparisons of one worker’s\\nperformance against that of other workers\\nRankings\\nThe comparative method of \\nrankings\\n requires supervisors to rank their direct reports from best to worst on\\nspecific performance dimensions or to give an overall comparative ranking on job performance (see Dominick,\\n2009). Although this is a simple and easy technique that supervisors are not likely to find difficult or time\\nconsuming, it has several limitations. Although ranking separates the best workers from the worst, there are no\\nabsolute standards of performance. This is a problem if few or none of the entire group of workers are\\nperforming at “acceptable” levels. In this case, being ranked second or third in a group of 15 is misleading,\\nbecause even the highest-ranking workers are performing at substandard levels. Conversely, in a group of\\nexceptional workers, those ranked low may actually be outstanding performers in comparison to other\\nemployees in the organization or workers in other companies.\\nRankings\\n performance appraisal methods involving the ranking of supervisees from best to worst\\n148', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 147}),\n",

Each person’s final rank consists of the number of times that individual was chosen as\\nthe better of a pair. The drawbacks of this technique are similar to those of the ranking method.

Most often the distribution is set up to represent a\\nnormal distribution (see \\nFigure 6.2\\n). This forced distribution evaluation \\ntechnique is similar to the procedure\\nused by an instructor who grades on a so-called “normal curve,” with preassigned percentages of A, B, C, D,\\nand F grades. One large U.S. company established a policy of placing all employees in a performance\\ndistribution with the bottom 10% of performers fired each year in an effort to continually upgrade the\\nperformance level of the entire workforce.\\nOne possible problem with the forced distribution occurs when there is an abundance of either very good or\\nvery poor workers in a supervisor’s work group. This can create a situation where a supervisor might\\nartificially raise or lower some employees’ evaluations to fit them into the predetermined distribution. In some\\nsituations, forced distributions may lead to employee dissatisfaction if it is perceived as unfair (Schleicher, Bull,\\n& Green, 2009) and, if used in a layoff situation, may raise concerns about adverse impact (Giumetti,\\nSchroeder, & Switzer, 2015).\\nInformation comparing the performance of one employee to that of others can be used in conjunction with\\nother performance appraisal methods. For example, a study by Farh and Dobbins (1989) found that when\\nsubordinates were presented with information comparing their job performance with that of their peers, their\\nself-ratings of performance were more accurate and there was greater agreement between self-appraisals and\\nappraisals made by supervisors.

However, even though ratings are\\nmade individually, appraisals using individual methods may still make comparisons of one individual\\nemployee’s rating with individual ratings of other employees. We will begin our discussion of individual\\nmethods with the most widely used method of performance rating: graphic rating scales.\\nIndividual Methods\\n performance appraisal methods that evaluate an employee by himself or herself,\\nwithout explicit reference to other workers\\nGraphic Rating Scales\\nThe vast majority of performance appraisals use \\ngraphic rating scales\\n, which offer predetermined scales to\\nrate the worker on a number of important aspects of the job, such as quality of work, dependability, and ability\\nto get along with coworkers. A graphic rating scale typically has a number of points with either numerical or\\nverbal labels, or both. The verbal labels can be simple, one-word descriptors, or they can be quite lengthy and\\nspecific (see \\nFigure 6.3\\n). Some graphic rating scales use only verbal endpoints, or anchors, with numbered\\nrating points between the two anchors.\\nGraphic Rating Scales\\n performance appraisal methods using a predetermined scale to rate the worker on\\nimportant job dimensions\\n150', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 149}),\n",

Because the relevant job dimensions change drastically from job to\\njob, it is critical that the dimensions being rated are those that actually assess performance of the particular job.\\nThe major weakness of graphic rating scales is that they may be prone to certain biased response patterns, such\\nas the tendency to give everyone “good” or “average” ratings. Also, limiting ratings to only a few job\\ndimensions may constrain the appraiser and may not produce a total picture of the worker’s job performance.\\nBehaviorally Anchored Rating Scales\\nAn outgrowth of the critical incidents method of job analysis is the development of \\nbehaviorally anchored\\nrating scales (BARS)\\n, which attempt to clearly define the scale labels and anchors used in performance ratings\\n(Smith & Kendall, 1963).

An appraiser is\\nforced to spend a great deal of time just thinking about what adequate or inadequate performance of a certain\\njob dimension entails, particularly if the rater had a hand in developing the scale.

The advantage of narratives is that appraisers have the freedom to describe performance in their\\nown words and to emphasize elements that they feel are important. Their major drawback is that they offer no\\nquantification of performance, which makes it very difficult to compare workers’ performance. An additional\\nproblem with narratives is that the worker may misinterpret the meaning of the report. For example, an\\nappraiser may write that the worker is doing a “fair job,” meaning that some improvement is needed, but the\\nworker may interpret the word “fair” to mean “adequate” or “good,” and may thus believe that no\\nimprovement is necessary. Another concern is that subtle bias may easily enter into the performance narrative\\nthat a supervisor writes (Wilson, 2010).\\nNarratives\\n open-ended written accounts of a worker’s performance used in performance appraisals\\nWe have seen that there are quite a number of methods for rating employee job performance, but what\\nworks best? All forms of ratings suffer from the same limitation: they are subjective, and thus prone to the\\nunique perspective and biases of the person doing the rating. No one method of rating performance has\\nemerged as superior to the others. However, a key issue is the focus of the rater’s attention on actual job\\nperformance (see DeNisi & Peters, 1996). Therefore, methods that focus raters on performance-related job\\nbehaviors—the BARS and BOS methods—should theoretically improve rater accuracy.\\nProblems and Pitfalls in Performance Appraisals\\nDespite the various performance appraisal tools designed to help obtain more objective assessments, the\\nappraisal evaluation process remains highly subjective. Because \\nappraisers selectively observe on-the-job\\nperformance and rate what they believe to be an individual’s performance level, their judgments are prone to a\\nnumber of systematic biases and distortions. A great deal of research has helped uncover some of these\\nproblems. Understanding these potential errors in the performance appraisal process can make it easier to\\ndevelop the means to combat them and to produce better appraisals of work performance. We will consider\\nseveral types of such systematic problems, including leniency/severity errors, halo effects, recency effects,\\ncausal attribution errors, and personal biases.\\nLeniency/Severity Errors\\nA \\nleniency error\\n in performance ratings occurs when an appraiser tends to judge all workers leniently,\\nroutinely giving them very positive appraisals (Hauenstein, 1992). A \\nseverity error\\n is the exact opposite and\\narises when an appraiser tends to rate employees on the low end of performance scales, giving generally\\nnegative appraisals. For the rater making a severity error, no performance ever seems good enough. There is\\nalso a \\ncentral tendency error\\n, whereby the appraiser tends always to use the midpoint of the rating scale. All\\nthree of these errors lead to the same problem: a short-circuiting of the appraisal process because the rater’s\\ntendency to use only one area of the performance scale does not actually discriminate among poor, fair, and\\noutstanding workers (Houston, Raymond, & Svec, 1991). In statistical terms, the ratings show little variance. As\\nshown, some techniques, such as the various comparative methods, help combat such response tendency\\n155', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 154}),\n",

If a particular worker did an outstanding job on a particular task, the supervisor assumes that all\\nof this person’s work is also outstanding, regardless of whether it really is. Certain personal characteristics\\nsuch as physical attractiveness or being labeled a “rising star” may also lead to halo effects (Landy & Sigall,\\n1974). Research indicates that halo effects occur because raters use the one salient characteristic as the basis for\\nforming an overall, generally positive or negative, impression of the worker’s performance (Lance, LaPointe, &\\nFisicaro, 1994). There is also a “reverse” halo effect, sometimes called the “rusty halo” or “horns” effect (Baron,\\n1986), in which an overall negative performance appraisal is made on the basis of one instance of failure or one\\nnegative characteristic.\\nHalo Effect\\n an overall positive evaluation of a worker based on one known positive characteristic or\\naction\\nBecause halo effects are such a common source of bias in performance appraisals, a number of rater training\\nprograms have been developed to try to control for them (Ivancevich, 1979; McIntyre, Smith, & Hassett, 1984;\\nPulakos, 1984). Many of these training programs involve simply making raters more aware of the phenomenon\\nof halo effects and helping them to focus on behavioral dimensions of job performance.\\nFigure 6.6\\n Using multiple evaluators increases the reliability of performance ratings.\\nSource:\\n wavebreakmedia/\\nShutterstock.com\\nRecency Effects\\nAnother potential error in performance appraisals is the tendency to give greater weight to recent performance\\n156', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 155}),\n",

Because performance\\nassessments usually rely on the appraiser’s memory of a worker’s past performance, there are bound to be\\nproblems related to accurate recall. In general, the greater the delay between the performance and the appraisal\\nof work behaviors, the less accurate the appraisal will be (Heneman & Wexley, 1983; Murphy & Balzar, 1986).\\nThe lesser value given to earlier performance because of the recency effect may not always be detrimental to\\naccurate performance appraisals, however. Earlier performance by a relatively new employee may reflect the\\nemployee’s learning period, where mistakes may be more numerous, whereas later performance may reflect\\nthe employee’s performance once he or she has more completely learned about the job.\\nRecency Effect\\n the tendency to give greater weight to recent performance and lesser weight to earlier\\nperformance\\nCausal Attribution Errors\\nThe process by which people ascribe cause to events or behaviors is known as \\ncausal attribution\\n. Research has\\nuncovered a number of systematic biases in causal attribution that have important implications for the\\naccuracy of performance appraisals. Two of these attributional biases are particularly relevant to performance\\nappraisals. The first causal attribution bias is the tendency for appraisers to give more extreme appraisals if\\nthey believe that the cause of a worker’s performance is rooted in effort rather than ability (Knowlton &\\nMitchell, 1980; Struthers, Weiner, & Allred, 1998). That is, if an appraiser feels that particularly high levels of\\nperformance were the result of great effort on the part of a worker, that worker will receive a more positive\\nperformance appraisal than one whose high levels of performance were perceived as resulting from possession\\nof natural ability or talent. Similarly, a performance failure due to a lack of sufficient effort will be judged\\nmore harshly than a failure believed to be caused by lack of ability.\\nCausal Attribution\\n the process by which people assign cause to events or behaviors\\nThe second pertinent bias in causal attribution is called the \\nactor–observer bias\\n (Jones & Nisbett, 1972).\\nThis bias is founded in the notion that in any event there is an actor—the person performing a behavior—and\\nan observer—the person watching and appraising the event and the actor’s behavior. In performance appraisals\\nthe worker is the actor and the appraiser is the observer. The bias in causal attribution occurs when the actor\\nand observer are each asked to state the cause of the particular event. In the case of performance appraisals, the\\nevent could be a particularly successful or unsuccessful work outcome. The actor tends to overemphasize the\\nrole that situational factors, such as luck, task difficulty, and the work environment, played in the result. In\\ncontrast, the observer has a tendency to attribute cause to dispositional factors, or personal characteristics of\\nthe actor such as ability, effort, and personality. This means that the performance appraiser tends to believe\\nthat performance is due primarily to qualities in the worker and tends to neglect the role that situational\\nfactors played in the performance outcome. Therefore, in certain situations of poor work performance, the\\nsupervisor may blame the worker, when the failure was actually due to circumstances beyond the control of\\nthe worker. On the other side, the worker is prone to overemphasizing situational factors and, in cases of\\nfailure, will try to lay the blame elsewhere, for example, by faulting the working conditions or coworkers. The\\nactor–observer bias not only leads to inaccurate perceptions of work performance, but is also one of the main\\nreasons that supervisors and supervisees do not always see eye to eye when it comes to performance appraisals\\n(see “Applying I/O Psychology”). Interestingly, in one study it was found that actors, but not observers, were\\naware of the actor–observer bias in specific rating situations, suggesting that workers may realize that\\nsupervisors are being biased, but may not be able to make their supervisors aware of it (Krueger, Ham, &\\nLinford, 1996).\\n157', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 156}),\n",

It even has been found that pregnancy can be a\\nsource of negative bias in performance appraisals (Halpert, Wilson, & Hickman, 1993). It is no secret that\\nwomen, ethnic minorities, older people, and people with disabilities are sometimes discriminated against in\\nperformance appraisals, despite legislation specifically designed to ensure fairness (Roberson, Galvin, &\\nCharles, 2007). However, reviews of research on racial and gender bias in performance appraisal concluded that\\nsuch bias may be less of a problem than commonly believed (Arvey & Murphy, 1998; Bowen, Swim, & Jacobs,\\n2000). On the other hand, having a close personal relationship with a supervisee, or merely liking for that\\nindividual over others, could bias appraisals in a favorable direction (Lefkowitz, 2000).\\nThere is also evidence that certain types of individuals are more prone to bias in performance appraisals. For\\nexample, in an interesting review of research, it was found that supervisors who have high levels of power over\\nthose they are evaluating tended to make more negative performance evaluations than supervisors who did not\\nhave as much power over supervisees (Georgesen & Harris, 1998). One explanation is that powerful individuals\\nattend more to negative stereotypic information about their subordinates, such as being particularly harsh in\\nan evaluation when an inexperienced, young worker makes a mistake (Rodríguez-Bailón, Moya, & Yzerbyt,\\n2000).\\nCertain personal biases may be deeply ingrained in individuals and are therefore difficult to overcome. As\\nwith other biases, one way to deal with personal biases is to make appraisers more aware of them. Because\\ndiscrimination in personnel procedures has been outlawed through federal civil rights legislation, most\\norganizations and managers are on the lookout to prevent such biases from leading to discrimination.\\nIronically, programs designed to protect against personal biases and subsequent discrimination may lead to\\ninstances of reverse discrimination, a bias toward favoring a member of a particular underrepresented group\\nover members of the majority group.\\nCross-Cultural and International Issues\\nThe individual focus of performance appraisals, where a single worker is the focus of the evaluation, is, in\\nmany ways, a Western/U.S. view of evaluating performance (Fletcher & Perry, 2001). In many non-U.S.\\ncultures, the focus is on the work group, or collective, instead of on individual performance. For instance,\\nJapanese and Russian workers may prefer receiving performance feedback at the group, rather than the\\nindividual, level (Elenkov, 1998; Erez, 1994). Research has also suggested that cultures that are less egalitarian\\nare less accepting of 360-degree performance appraisals, presumably because there is resistance to the idea of\\nhaving lower-level workers and peers evaluate managers’ performance (Peretz & Fried, 2012). There may also\\nbe cultural norms regarding how direct and “blunt” feedback can be (Fletcher & Perry, 2001). Because of the\\npersonal nature of traditional performance appraisals, it is important that cultural norms and expectations be\\nconsidered in the development and delivery of a performance appraisal system.\\n \\nStop \\n&\\n Review\\nDescribe five sources or types of error/bias in performance appraisals.\\n158', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 157}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Applying I/O Psychology\\nCombating the Actor–Observer Bias in Performance Appraisals\\nThe actor–observer bias, or the tendency for actors to make situational attributions and for observers to\\nmake dispositional attributions, is a particular problem in performance appraisals that can lead to\\ninaccurate assessments and cause rifts between the evaluating supervisor and subordinates. How can this\\nbias be overcome?\\nOne way to try to combat this problem is to create performance rating forms that require the evaluator\\nto take into account the various situational factors that may have hampered the employee’s performance\\n(Bernardin, Hagan, Kane, & Villanova, 1998). Although this strategy can avoid some of the observer bias,\\nthere may still be some tendencies toward overattributing cause to dispositional characteristics of the\\nworker. An even better remedy is to change the perspective of the observers/evaluators by providing\\nthem with direct experience with the actor’s job. Because much of the actor–observer bias is the result of\\nthe differing perspectives of the actor and the observer, putting the observer/appraiser “in the shoes” of\\nthe actor/worker can help the observer see conditions as the actor sees them (Mitchell & Kalb, 1982).\\nA large savings and loan organization has done just that. All supervisors who are responsible for\\nconducting the performance appraisals of customer service representatives—tellers and loan officers—\\nmust spend one week during each appraisal period working in customer service. The belief is that because\\nmany of these supervisors are far removed from the customer service situation, they are unable to\\nevaluate objectively the pressures that the workers have to deal with, such as difficult or irate customers.\\nProviding appraisers with this direct experience helps them take into account the situational variables\\nthat affect employees’ performance, thus leading to more accurate assessments.\\nA common misconception is that the actor–observer bias will be overcome if both supervisor\\nperformance appraisals and workers’ self-appraisals are obtained. However, if the actor–observer bias is\\noperating, all this will produce is two very discrepant performance appraisals: one from the supervisor,\\nblaming the worker for poor performance, and one from the worker, blaming the situation. Peer\\nevaluations likewise will not be of much help, because coworkers are also subject to the actor–observer\\nbias. Peer evaluations will also overattribute cause to characteristics of the person being appraised,\\nbecause the coworker is also an observer.\\nThe Dynamic Nature of Performance Today\\nIn today’s modern world of work, many jobs constantly change and evolve. The measures used to evaluate\\nperformance at one point in a job may not still be valid a short time later, as the job requirements “morph” into\\nsomething very different. This is particularly true in start-up organizations, where jobs may become either\\nmore specialized over time or become broader, quickly encompassing new duties and responsibilities.\\nAnother concern is that annual, biannual, or even quarterly performance reviews are far too infrequent to\\nadequately assess ongoing performance and provide more immediate performance feedback. Many managers,\\nand even HR professionals, are becoming disenchanted with traditional performance reviews due to concerns\\nabout the accuracy of measurement and the long time intervals between evaluations (SHRM, 2015). As a result,\\nmany organizations are abandoning traditional performance reviews and using briefer, and more frequent,\\n“check-ins”—which are like mini performance assessments. For example, General Electric (GE) has eliminated\\nannual performance reviews and instead has managers conduct regular feedback sessions via a smartphone app\\nthat was designed in-house (Baldassarre & Finken, 2015).\\nOther organizations are turning to more frequent assessment of performance goals, believing there are\\nimportant advantages to using smartphone apps or online check-ins to provide more immediate feedback from\\nmanagers and from other team members. There are several advantages:\\n159', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 158}),\n",

This is particularly true when companies decide to use 360-degree evaluations, which\\nrequires sophisticated technology to collect and analyze the data. As a result, there is a growing industry that\\nhelps organizations with performance reviews, often offering their own evaluation instruments and rating\\nscales that the organization can adopt or customize for their own use. When using these outside services,\\nhowever, it is important that the organization be engaged in the selection and/or the creation of the\\nperformance review measures and should monitor the process to make sure that it is being done correctly and\\neffectively.\\nThe Performance Appraisal Process\\nIn the past few decades, research on performance appraisals has focused more on the cognitive processes\\nunderlying performance appraisal decisions—how an evaluator arrives at an overall evaluation of a worker’s\\nperformance (Bretz, Milkovich, & Read, 1992; Feldman, 1981; Kravitz & Balzer, 1992). This research views\\nperformance appraisal as a complex, decision-making process, looking at (a) how information about the\\nworker’s performance is acquired; (b) how the \\nevaluator organizes and stores information about a worker’s\\nperformance behaviors; and (c) how the evaluator retrieves and translates the stored information in making the\\nactual performance appraisal (Ilgen, Barnes-Farrell, & McKellin, 1993; Judge & Ferris, 1993).\\nThe results of several studies suggest that evaluators form ongoing, or “online,” evaluations of others\\n(Murphy, Philbin, & Adams, 1989; Woehr, 1992). That is, evaluators form opinions as they observe behavior\\nday to day, rather than just waiting until the time a formal performance rating is required and then forming an\\nopinion based solely on memory. Because evaluation of performance is an ongoing, information-processing\\ntask, evaluators should be presented with the performance appraisal rating instruments up front so that they\\ncan familiarize themselves with the rating dimensions before they begin to observe and evaluate performance\\n(Woehr, 1992). Having this knowledge of rating dimensions beforehand has been shown to increase the\\nagreement between supervisor ratings and self-ratings of workers’ performance (Williams & Levy, 1992). In\\naddition, it may be helpful for evaluators to keep diaries or daily records of individual employee performance.\\nIt has been found that using diaries as a means for structuring information in memory increases the accuracy\\nof evaluators’ recall. In research, evaluators who used diaries to record performance information were more\\naccurate in their recall and were also more accurate in their appraisals of worker performance (DeNisi &\\nPeters, 1996; DeNisi, Robbins, & Cafferty, 1989).\\nThe performance appraisal process involves more than just the process of evaluating and rating worker\\nperformance. A good performance appraisal should consist of two parts. The first is the performance\\nassessment, or the means of measuring a worker’s performance to make personnel decisions. This part we have\\ndiscussed at length. The second part is \\nperformance feedback\\n, which is the process of providing information\\nto a worker regarding performance level with suggestions for improving future performance (Boswell &\\nBoudreau, 2002; London & Mone, 2015). Performance feedback typically occurs in the context of the\\nperformance appraisal interview. Here, the supervisor typically sits down face to face with the worker and\\nprovides a detailed analysis of the worker’s performance, giving positive, constructive criticism and\\nsuggestions and guidelines for improvement. Guidelines for effective feedback are given in \\nTable 6.3\\n. Although\\nconstructive feedback is critical to a good performance appraisal, more “informal” feedback from supervisor to\\nsubordinate should take place regularly on a day-today basis (Farr, 1993).\\n160', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 159}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Performance Feedback\\n the process of giving information to a worker about performance level with\\nsuggestions for future improvement\\nBecause of the importance of performance appraisals, the appraisal process is likely to have some\\npsychological and emotional effects on the worker. It is crucial that the supervisor be aware of this potential\\nimpact of the procedure and be equipped to deal with the worker’s possible reactions (Kinicki, Prussia, Wu, &\\nMcKee-Ryan, 2004). Whether the worker perceives the performance appraisal process positively or negatively,\\nand how the worker acts on the information provided in the feedback session, are in large part determined by\\nhow the information is presented by the supervisor (Ilgen, Fisher, & Taylor, 1979; Kluger & DeNisi, 1996).\\nResearch has shown that if the appraiser demonstrates support for the worker and welcomes the worker’s\\ninput and participation in the assessment process, the performance appraisal is usually more effective\\n(Cederblom, 1982; Wexley, 1986). For example, in one study, workers participated in the construction of\\nbehaviorally anchored rating scales to appraise their performance. These workers had more favorable\\nperceptions of the appraisal process and were more motivated to try to improve their performance than were\\nworkers who did not have a hand in developing their rating instruments (Silverman & Wexley, 1984). Research\\nhas also indicated that training programs for appraisers that include training in providing feedback and in\\ndealing with workers’ possible reactions to that feedback are effective in improving the entire performance\\nappraisal process (Ivancevich, 1982; Spence & Baratta, 2015) (see “Up Close” for suggestions on how to improve\\nperformance appraisals, and see \\nTable 6.4\\n, which provides suggestions for appraiser training programs).\\nTable 6.3\\n Guidelines for Effective Performance Feedback\\n1.

       " Document(page_content=' \\nClose\\n How to Improve Performance Appraisals\\nGiven the pervasiveness of biases and errors in performance appraisals, how can the appraisal process\\nbe improved? Research suggests several ways to improve the process.\\n1\\n. \\nImprove performance appraisal techniques\\n—Generally, the more time and energy devoted to the\\ndevelopment of detailed, valid instruments for measuring performance, the better the overall\\nquality of the performance appraisal. This means creating different performance appraisal\\ninstruments for different job classifications. (You can’t, for example, use the same generic rating\\nform for both frontline workers and managerial personnel.) These measures of performance\\nmust evolve from detailed job analyses and should involve relatively straightforward and\\nunambiguous procedures (Yammarino & Waldman, 1993).\\n2\\n. \\nTrain the appraisers\\n—Because conducting good performance appraisals is a difficult process,\\nprone to error and potential bias, it is imperative that appraisers be adequately trained. They\\nmust be taught how to use the various appraisal instruments and should be instructed to avoid\\npossible errors, such as halo effects and leniency/severity errors (Bernardin & Bulkley, 1981;\\nHedge & Kavanagh, 1988; Woehr & Huffcutt, 1994). Moreover, evidence suggests that appraisers\\nshould be knowledgeable of the performance appraisal methods and procedures up front, before\\nthey begin observing workers’ performance (Woehr, 1994).\\n3\\n. \\nObtain multiple evaluations\\n—One way to increase the reliability of performance appraisals is to\\nuse multiple ratings, such as more than one supervisor rating or a combination of supervisor\\nratings, self-appraisals, and peer appraisals (Fletcher, 2015). If the results of the multiple\\nappraisals agree with one another, and if all the appraisers are not influenced by a common\\nbias, it is likely that the result will be a more accurate assessment of performance.\\n4\\n. \\nAppraise appraisers\\n—Unfortunately, in many organizations supervisors detest conducting\\nperformance appraisals because they view the assessments as a difficult and thankless task—\\nextra work piled onto an already heavy workload (Spence & Baratta, 2015). To get supervisors\\nto take performance appraisals seriously, it is important that the task of conducting assessments\\nbe considered an integral part of their job. This means that the quality of the supervisors’\\nperformance appraisals should be assessed and that the supervisors should also receive feedback\\nabout their performance of this crucial task. High-quality appraisals need to be rewarded.\\n5\\n. \\nConduct performance appraisals regularly and often\\n—Performance appraisals serve not only as\\ntools to assist in personnel decisions, but also as a source of feedback for the worker. Frequent\\nand regular assessments are one of the best ways to help workers learn to overcome problems\\nand improve performance (Cummings & Schwab, 1978). The use of check-ins mentioned earlier\\ncan be used in addition to more formal performance reviews.\\n6\\n. \\nReview and revise performance appraisals\\n—As jobs change because of technological innovations\\nand organizational restructuring, performance appraisal systems must be constantly updated to\\ndeal with the changing nature of the jobs being evaluated.\\nLegal Concerns in Performance Appraisals\\nBecause performance appraisals are tied to personnel actions such as promotions, demotions, and raises, they\\nare carefully scrutinized in terms of fair employment legislation (Latham & Mann, 2006; Martin, Bartol, &\\nKehoe, 2000). Under these legal guidelines, any performance appraisal must be valid. Historically, court cases\\nhave ruled that to be considered “valid,” appraisals must be based on a job analysis and must be validated\\nagainst the job duties that the workers actually perform (\\nAlbemarle Paper v. Moody\\n, 1975; \\nUnited States v. City\\n162', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 161}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='of Chicago\\n, 1978). Moreover, performance appraisals need to be administered and scored under controlled and\\nstandardized conditions (\\nBrito v. Zia Company\\n, 1973). Specifically, court cases have ruled that appraisers must\\nreceive training, or at least written instructions, on how to conduct performance appraisals, that assessments\\nmust focus on performance-related behaviors rather than on performance-related personality traits or other\\ndispositional variables, and that appraisals must be reviewed with the employees (Barrett & Kernan, 1987; Feild\\n& Holley, 1982). In addition, just as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that employers make\\nreasonable accommodations for disabled workers in performing their jobs, performance appraisals of these\\nworkers need to take into account both the disability and the accommodations to avoid discrimination in the\\nappraisal.\\nHistorically, employers in the U.S. have had the right to terminate an employee, with or without cause, in\\nwhat is called “employment-at-will” rights. With increased \\nemployment litigation, however, this right to fire at\\nwill has been challenged. Most often discharged employees have argued that there was an “implied\\nemployment contract,” such as promises made by an employer. For example, before deregulation of provision\\nof utilities (e.g., electricity), many utility employees were led to believe that they had “lifetime employment”\\nbecause workers were rarely fired or laid off. However, in the more competitive post-deregulation\\nenvironment, utility companies needed to downsize, causing many of the laid-off workers to seek legal\\nrecourse. To prevent problems in this area, employers should be careful to fully inform new employees about\\nemployment-at-will and should avoid making any sort of real or implied “contracts” or promises regarding\\nfuture employment. This is also another reason why performance appraisals need to be accurate, frequent, and\\nbacked up with good recordkeeping. For instance, if an employee had a record of mediocre or substandard\\nperformance and the person is one of the first to be let go during a work-force reduction, having accurate\\nrecords of the employee’s performance will reduce the company’s exposure should the employee seek legal\\nrecourse.\\nTeam Appraisals\\nThe increase in team-based work groups has important implications for the use of performance appraisals. It\\nhas been argued that true work teams, where workers complete highly interdependent tasks, with shared team\\ngoals, should be appraised as a team, rather than using traditional individual appraisals (Delery, Gupta,\\nJenkins, & Walker, 1998; Wildman, Bedwell, Salas, & Smith-Jentsch, 2011). One model suggests that a good\\nappraisal of team performance should assess team members’ competencies (knowledge, skills), their team\\nbehaviors (effective communication, collaboration, decision making), and the total team performance (output,\\nquality) (Reilly & McGourty, 1998). Often, team performance appraisals may require team members to evaluate\\none another, as well as an evaluation by the supervisor or team leader of the team as a unit.\\nThe shift toward team approaches, as well as the fact that the nature and structure of many jobs change\\nquickly over time, presents special challenges to performance appraisal. Performance appraisal systems,\\ntherefore, need to be subject to constant review and revision. Smither (1998) argued that performance appraisal\\nshould not be an end product, but should be integrated into day-to-day performance, employee development,\\nand the greater goals of the organization. Employees need to be active participants in the appraisal process if\\nthey are to perceive it as fair and have a positive, constructive reaction to the appraisals (Gilliland & Langdon,\\n1998; Greenberg, 1986).\\n \\nStop \\n&\\n Review\\nOutline five techniques for improving performance appraisals.\\nSummary\\n163', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 162}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='A thorough job analysis is the starting point for measuring and evaluating actual job performance.\\nPerformance appraisals\\n involve the assessment of worker performance \\non the basis of predetermined\\norganizational standards. Performance appraisals serve many important purposes, including being the basis for\\npersonnel decisions and a means of assessing performance. One way to categorize performance is in terms of\\nobjective and subjective criteria. \\nObjective performance criteria\\n are more quantifiable measurements of\\nperformance, such as the number of units produced or dollar sales. \\nSubjective performance criteria\\n typically\\ninvolve judgments or ratings of performance. Concerns for a performance criterion include whether it is\\nrelevant to job success, called \\ncriterion relevance\\n; whether the criterion contains elements that detract from the\\n“pure” assessment of performance, termed \\ncriterion contamination\\n; whether the degree to which a criterion\\nfalls short of perfect assessment of job performance, called \\ncriterion deficiency\\n; and whether the criterion is\\nusable, called \\ncriterion usefulness\\n.\\nResearch on ratings of job performance has examined who is making performance ratings. Self-appraisals\\nare ratings or evaluations made by the workers themselves. Peer appraisals involve coworkers rating each\\nother’s performance. In some instances, subordinates may rate the performance of their supervisors. Most\\ncommon, of course, are supervisory ratings of subordinates’ performance. \\n360-degree feedback\\n involves getting\\nmultiple performance evaluations from supervisors, peers, subordinates, and customers.\\nThere are a variety of methods for rating performance. \\nComparative methods\\n of appraisal, such as the paired\\ncomparison and forced distribution techniques, directly compare one worker’s performance with that of\\nanother worker’s. \\nIndividual methods\\n of appraisal do not make direct comparisons with other workers.\\nIndividual methods include \\nchecklists\\n and forced-choice scales and are easy-to-use methods of appraisal that\\nrequire the evaluator simply to check off statements characteristic or uncharacteristic of a particular worker’s\\njob performance. The most common method of individual performance appraisal involves the use of \\ngraphic\\nrating scales\\n, whereby an appraiser uses a standardized rating instrument to make a numerical and/or verbal\\nrating of various dimensions of job performance. A specific type of rating technique, the \\nbehaviorally anchored\\nrating scale\\n (BARS), uses examples of good and poor behavioral incidents as substitutes for the scale anchors\\nfound in traditional rating instruments.\\nA major problem in rating job performance is caused by systematic biases and errors. Response tendency\\nerrors, such as \\nleniency/severity\\n or \\ncentral tendency errors\\n, lead to consistently good, bad, or average ratings,\\nrespectively. \\nHalo effects\\n occur when appraisers make overall positive (or negative) performance appraisals\\nbecause of one known outstanding characteristic or action. There are also errors caused by giving greater\\nweight to more recent performance, known as \\nrecency effects\\n, and various attribution errors, including the\\nactor–observer bias\\n. The latter may lead an appraiser to place greater emphasis on dispositional factors and\\nlesser emphasis on situational factors that may have affected performance.\\nA good performance appraisal consists of two parts: the performance assessment and \\nperformance feedback\\n.\\nThe feedback should occur in a face-to-face situation in which the supervisor provides constructive\\ninformation, encouragement, and guidelines for the improvement of the worker’s future performance.\\nBecause performance appraisals are important to the worker’s livelihood and career advancement, there are\\nconsiderable legal overtones to the appraisal process. Performance appraisals must be valid procedures,\\nresulting from job analysis, that do not unfairly discriminate against any group of workers.\\nBecause of the proliferation of work teams, organizations are developing team appraisals—evaluating an\\ninterdependent group of workers as a unit.

The section on assessing training needs is in some ways related to the discussion of job analysis\\nprocedures in \\nChapter 3\\n, except that now we are assessing what knowledge, skills, abilities, and other\\ncharacteristics (KSAOs) workers need to perform their jobs rather than analyzing the jobs themselves.

Because training relates to\\nmany personnel decisions, some of the legal concerns regarding equal employment opportunity that we looked\\nat in \\nChapters 5\\n and \\n6\\n are relevant here too. It is important to consider how employee training ties in with the\\nother personnel and employee issues studied previously.\\nYou have just graduated from college. You went through the arduous process of applying for jobs, being\\nscreened, interviewed, and “courted” to some extent by your employer. You are anxious to get to work—to\\nshow them what you can do and to make your mark on the company. However, before you are able to get\\nstarted, the company sends you to a training center where you will learn the basics of the job, learn company\\npolicies and procedures, and learn about the culture of your new organization.\\nEmployee training\\n is a planned effort by an organization to facilitate employees’ learning, retention, and\\ntransfer of job-related behavior.

During orientation new employees also learn about compensation, benefits, and\\nsafety rules and procedures. Orientation programs can also introduce employees to the organization’s mission\\nand vision and help employees begin to internalize the organization’s vision, values, and culture (Kim, Chai,\\nKim, & Park, 2015). In short, initial training should provide enough information so that new employees can\\nquickly become productive members of the organization’s workforce. In fact, there is some evidence that when\\nit comes to employee orientation and early training, more is better (Saks, 1996). An additional function of an\\norientation program is to help newcomers deal with the stresses of adjusting to a new work environment\\n168', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 167}),\n",

In fact, research shows that new workers are often eager and willing to\\nlearn (Morrison, 1993). Moreover, evidence suggests that employees receiving adequate initial training are\\nmore satisfied and less likely to quit during the first six months of a job than workers who receive little initial\\ntraining (Wanous, Poland, Premack, & Davis, 1992; Wanous, Stumpf, & Bedrosian, 1979). It has been suggested\\nthat adequate new employee orientation programs can pay huge dividends over time in increased employee\\nproductivity and increased satisfaction with the job and the organization (Acevedo & Yancey, 2011; Hacker,\\n2004).\\nIt is important to note that initial employee orientation is mainly designed to acquaint new employees with\\nthe organization and with basic organizational processes (Wesson & Gogus, 2005). (See \\nFigure 7.1\\n for an\\nexample of an employee orientation program checklist.) A more in-depth process of socializing employees into\\nthe organization will be discussed in \\nChapter 11\\n.\\nRetraining and Continuing Education Programs\\nConsiderable evidence indicates that a certain amount of the knowledge and skills of workers either erodes or\\nbecomes obsolete during their work careers (London & Bassman, 1989). To maintain workers’ proficiencies,\\norganizations must encourage and support basic “refresher courses” as well as continuing education programs\\nthat provide workers with new information. With rapid technological advancements, it is critical that the skills\\nand knowledge of persons employed in jobs that require the use of advanced technology be constantly updated.\\nFigure 7.2\\n \\nAn employer-sponsored session for retirement planning.\\nSource:\\n Alexander Raths/\\nShutterstock.com\\nCertain professionals, particularly those in licensed health care professions such as medicine, dentistry, and\\nclinical psychology, require some form of continuing education to continue to work in the field.

For example, in one study, employees showed more commitment to the organization after training and\\nthere was a short-term decrease in absenteeism, presumably because employees realize that the firm is\\ninvesting in them (Kampkotter & Marggraf, 2015).

Research suggests that many workers do not prepare well (or at all) for retirement (Kim\\n& Moen, 2001). Seminars are offered on such topics as making the retirement decision, retirement plans and\\noptions, investment and money management, and services and opportunities for retirees and seniors. More\\ngeneral programs aimed at helping retirees adjust to a nonworking lifestyle are also offered. An increase in\\npre-retirement training programs reflects a general trend toward more employee training and greater concern\\nfor employees’ pre- and postretirement welfare. One study found that both pre- and postretirement planning\\nwere needed for employees to successfully retire (Donaldson, Earl, & Muratore, 2010).

In some cases, workers may work for a foreign-based\\ncompany, or they may spend some time working in a host country. Working in another culture requires\\nspecialized training (Noe, 2013; Shen, 2005; Tung, 1997).\\nThere are many important objectives for programs to train employees for work in international settings.\\nSome of the skills required for working in another culture include foreign language skills, knowledge of the\\nhost country’s general culture, and knowledge of the country’s specific business culture and work rules (Ronen,\\n1989). Some scholars have suggested that the best workers—those who can easily adjust to different\\ninternational assignments—are those who possess what has been called “cultural intelligence” (Offermann &\\nPhan, 2002). More recently, it has been suggested that managers who are destined for international assignment\\nshould view this sort of cross-cultural training as an ongoing process of development (Teagarden, 2007).\\nTraining in Diversity Issues, Harassment, and Ethical Behavior\\nWith internationalization and increased access to jobs, work groups are becoming increasingly diverse, with\\ngreater national and cultural diversity, and more women in the workforce. This has prompted organizations to\\nallocate resources to diversity training programs and efforts to prevent harassment, including sexual\\nharassment. Besides helping to fight discrimination against specific groups of employees, diversity training is\\nalso aimed at capitalizing on the advantages of diverse work teams, as we saw in \\nChapter 1\\n.\\nMost diversity training programs seek to raise employees’ awareness of diversity issues, to try to increase\\nunderstanding of people from other backgrounds and cultures, and to strive to change negative attitudes and\\nbehaviors. There is evidence that \\ndiversity training can help employees in the implementation of diversity\\ninitiatives and making such programs work (Combs & Luthans, 2007). Companies with top diversity training\\nprograms include Kaiser Permanente, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, and Sodexo. The Hong Kong Bank and the\\nBank of Montreal have long-standing training programs to deal with issues related to gender, racial, and\\ncultural diversity (Tung, 1997).\\nNearly one-third of U.S. women report being sexually harassed at work, with more than half reporting they\\nexperienced potentially harassing behaviors (Catalyst, 2015; Ilies, Hauserman, Schwochau, & Stibal, 2003). As a\\nresult, employee sexual harassment training is becoming mandatory in many areas. Research evidence suggests\\nthat sexual harassment is affected by the organizational culture and climate (Fitzgerald, Drasgow, Hulin,\\nGelfand, & Magley, 1997). As a result, a majority of U.S. companies have developed training programs designed\\nto reduce sexual harassment in the workplace. Many of these programs focus on increasing awareness of\\nharassing behavior (e.g., Blakely, Blakely, & Moorman, 1998; Fielden & Hunt, 2014) and trying to neutralize\\nsituations and “cultures” that promote or allow sexual harassment. There is some evidence that sexual\\nharassment training does indeed have positive effects, particularly in helping male employees better\\nunderstand what sorts of behaviors constitute sexual harassment (Antecol & Cobb-Clark, 2003). In addition, it\\nhas been suggested that sexual harassment training needs to focus both at the individual employee level and at\\nthe work group or team level (Buchanan, Settles, Hall, & O’Connor, 2014; Raver & Gelfand, 2005).\\nAlthough health care workers, lawyers, and other professional workers have had regular training in\\nprofessional ethics, there has recently been increased attention to ethics training for a broader range of\\nworkers. In light of the many high-profile corporate ethical scandals, many organizations have developed\\nethics training programs for managers and for rank-and-file employees (Weber, 2015). Moreover, business\\nschools have placed increased emphasis on ethics courses, although there is some concern about the success of\\nethics training courses (Allen, Bacdayan, Kowalski, & Roy, 2005; Cornuel & Hommel, 2015). There is some\\npreliminary evidence that ethics training in business does have positive effects (Valentine & Fleischman, 2004).\\n171', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 170}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Team Training\\nAs organizations rely more and more on work teams, I/O psychologists and HR professionals have begun to\\nrealize the importance of training aimed at developing the team as a group, rather than the individual focus\\nthat is common to most employee training programs (Hollenbeck, DeRue, & Guzzo, 2004; Stagl, Salas, & Burke,\\n2007). Team training programs typically have several components: (a) gaining an understanding of the\\nknowledge and skills of each of the individual group members; (b) training in teamwork skills (e.g., how to\\ncoordinate activities, how to fairly distribute workload, group problem solving and decision making); and (c)\\ndeveloping shared goals and work procedures (Campbell & Kuncel, 2001). As you \\nmight imagine, team training\\nis critical to certain groups, such as airline cockpit crews (Helmreich, Merritt, & Wilhelm, 1999) and health care\\nteams (Hughes et al., 2016). Cannon-Bowers and Salas (1997) suggested that successful team training should\\nmeasure both team and individual performance with feedback provided so that team members can learn to\\ndiagnose and evaluate their own performance within the team.\\nFundamental Issues in Employee Training\\nEmployee training is rooted in basic theories of learning. Designers of good employee training programs are\\nfamiliar with learning theories and principles. Most relevant theories for employee training are social learning\\ntheory and cognitive theories of learning. \\nSocial learning theory\\n emphasizes the observational learning of\\nbehavior (Bandura, 1977). A key process in social learning theory is modeling. \\nModeling\\n is imitative learning\\nthat occurs through observing and reproducing another person’s action, such as when an employee learns to\\noperate a piece of machinery by watching a supervisor work with the equipment and imitating the supervisor’s\\nactions. \\nCognitive theories of learning\\n view workers as information processors, focusing on how new\\ninformation is stored and retrieved and how that information is used to produce work behavior (Howell &\\nCooke, 1989; Tannenbaum & Yukl, 1992). Cognitive theories are particularly useful in understanding complex\\nthought processes, such as how workers can go beyond learned information and come up with novel and\\ncreative solutions or ideas.\\nSocial Learning Theory\\n learning theory that emphasizes the observational learning of behavior\\nModeling\\n learning that occurs through the observation and imitation of the behavior of others\\nCognitive Theories of Learning\\n learning theories that emphasize that humans are information\\nprocessors\\nKey Issues in the Success of Training Programs\\nIf employee training programs are to be successful, a number of key issues should be considered. For example,\\nwe must take care to see that learning achieved during the training sessions actually transfers to new behaviors\\nat the worksite. We also need to consider the trainees’ willingness and readiness to learn. In addition, we need\\nto look at the structure of the training program in terms of when, where, and how training will take place.\\nLet’s look more closely at these key training issues.\\nTransfer of Training\\nAn important concern is the \\ntransfer of training\\n (Baldwin & Ford, 1988; Burke, Hutchins, & Saks, 2013). How\\nwell does learning transfer from the training situation to the actual work environment? Because training\\ntransfer is influenced by the degree of similarity between the training tasks and the actual job tasks, the most\\nuseful training programs directly address the actual tasks that are performed on the job. Positive transfer of\\n172', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 171}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='learned tasks has been found to be maximized when there are identical stimulus and response elements found\\nin the training and in job situations (Wexley & McCellin, 1987). Transfer of training will also be more likely if\\nthe work environment supports the new behaviors that are learned (Zumrah & Boyle, 2015) and if the work\\nenvironment allows the trainee an opportunity to use those newly learned behaviors (Kim, 2004; Tracey,\\nTannenbaum, & Kavanagh, 1995). Training transfer is also more likely to occur if the employee voluntarily\\nchooses to enroll in the training program, as opposed to being required to attend the training (Curado,\\nHenriques, & Ribeiro, 2015).\\nTransfer of Training\\n concept dealing with whether training is actually applied in the work setting\\nSetting training goals and receiving feedback and reinforcement for achieving training goals also positively\\naffect training transfer (Winters & Latham, 1996). One study found that when trainees set goals for\\nimplementing the training strategies and feedback was given concerning the achievement of those goals, the\\ntrained behaviors tended to stay in place (Wexley & Baldwin, 1986). Without feedback and reinforcement,\\nlearned skills or procedures may deteriorate as workers forget some of their important elements, pick up bad\\nhabits that interfere with their application, or lapse into using old work strategies (Marx, 1982). Thus, concern\\nshould be given to the maintenance of newly learned work behaviors. It is important that workers see the\\nconnection between the learning of new behaviors and how the use of the new learning will enhance their\\nworking lives. “Brush-up” or reminder training sessions should follow a few months down the line. In short,\\ntraining should take place on a regular basis, be thorough, and continue throughout an employee’s career. For\\neffective transfer and maintenance of learning, employees must see that learning new work skills helps them to\\nbe better, more productive workers, which in turn can lead to promotions and other forms of career\\nadvancement.\\nTrainee Readiness\\nA second consideration is what could be termed \\ntrainee readiness\\n. A great deal of research indicates that\\npositive employee attitudes toward training programs are critical for training success (Noe, 1986; Warr &\\nBunce, 1995; Webster & Martocchio, 1993). Is the trainee prepared to learn? Does the trainee feel the need for\\ntraining and see the usefulness of the material that will be learned? Trainee ability, or “trainability,” is another\\nimportant factor to consider (Kanfer & Ackerman, 1989). For example, does the employee possess the basic\\nprerequisites to be a good candidate for learning these new behaviors? In other words, does the trainee have\\nthe aptitude to learn? Finally, if a training program is going to be successful, we must consider the trainee’s\\nmotivation (Tharenou, 2001). If an individual has no desire to learn new tasks and to take on new\\nresponsibilities, it is unlikely that much learning will take place (Baldwin & Magjuka, 1997; Baldwin, Magjuka,\\n& Loher, 1991). Or if a trainee feels unable to master the material—if he or she feels the material is “beyond\\nreach”—learning will be adversely affected (Mathieu, Martineau, & Tannenbaum, 1993). \\nThe concept of\\nreadiness is particularly important when looking at the training and development of higher-level positions in\\nmanagement and leadership (Day, 2013). Moreover, research has indicated that both giving employees a\\nrealistic preview of what the training program is about and providing them with the personal and career-\\nrelated benefits have positive effects on both trainee reactions to the program and their learning (Martocchio,\\n1993; Smith-Jentsch, Jentsch, Payne, & Salas, 1996; Webster & Martocchio, 1995).\\nTrainee Readiness\\n the individual’s potential for successful training\\nAn important issue in some highly skilled, highly specialized jobs, such as surgeon or air traffic controller, is\\nthe readiness for a trainee to move from working in a simulated environment to actually performing the job.\\n173', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 172}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='This sort of trainee readiness has been studied in the medical profession, where simulations are used\\nextensively before the doctor is allowed to practice on an actual patient (McGaghie, Issenberg, Petrusa, &\\nScalese, 2010).\\nTraining Program Structure\\nA third issue concerns the structure of the training program. When and how often does training take place?\\nHow long are the training sessions? How much opportunity is there for trainees to practice or apply what they\\nhave learned? How much guidance and individual attention does each trainee receive?\\nThe bulk of research evidence does indeed support the old adage that “practice makes perfect.” In fact,\\nevidence indicates that practice should continue to the point of overlearning, or where practice continues even\\nafter the trainee has established that the material has been learned (Driskell, Willis, & Copper, 1992; McGeehee\\n& Thayer, 1961). Should the practice be continuous, in what is called massed practice, or should practice\\nsessions be spaced over time? Nearly all evidence supports spaced over massed practice, particularly if the\\npractice involves retrieval-type learning (such as a recall test) rather than recognition learning (Schmidt &\\nBjork, 1992). Students are probably familiar with this. Studying course material in continuous, spaced sessions\\nover the semester beats intense, last-minute “cramming” nearly every time!\\nTraining research has also looked at whether it is better to segment the material into parts, in what is called\\npart learning, or to present the material as a whole (\\nwhole learning\\n). The research evidence suggests that whole\\nlearning is better than \\npart learning\\n, particularly when the trainees have high levels of cognitive abilities\\n(Adams, 1987). For example, teaching a worker to operate a bulldozer would be more successful if presented as\\na whole task, such as learning to manipulate the controls that both drive the vehicle and operate the shovel, as\\nopposed to learning the two tasks separately, particularly because operating a bulldozer requires driving while\\ncontrolling the shovel simultaneously.\\nAnother critical element is providing trainees with feedback about learning accomplishments. To be\\neffective, feedback must be immediate rather than delayed. If the feedback is delayed, it will be less effective\\nbecause workers tend to distance themselves from past actions. More feedback is generally better, although\\nthere is a point where too much feedback may only serve to overload and confuse trainees. \\nResearch has also\\nshown that positive feedback—information about what a trainee has done right—is more effective than\\nnegative feedback, which focuses on what the trainee has done wrong (Martocchio & Webster, 1992).\\nFinally, evidence indicates that to be effective, training programs should be highly structured to increase the\\nmeaningfulness of the material to be learned (Fantuzzo, Riggio, Connelly, & Dimeff, 1989; Wexley & Latham,\\n1991). Adding structure to training programs may involve presenting a general overview of the material to\\ntrainees before actual training begins and imposing a logical or orderly sequence on the presentation of the\\ntraining material. Trainees should also be made aware of the importance and goals of practicing newly learned\\nskills (Cannon-Bowers, Rhodenizer, Salas, & Bowers, 1998).\\nCommon Problems in Employee Training Programs\\nEstimates of the cost of personnel training in the U.S. alone range from the tens of billions to the hundreds of\\nbillions of dollars per year. Yet one problem with many personnel training programs is that although\\norganizations make a major commitment to training in terms of time, money, and other resources, training\\nprograms are not as effective as they could be, partly because they do not adequately follow sound learning\\nprinciples. Another problem is that employee training programs in some companies are not well organized.\\nPerhaps you have even experienced such “haphazard” training in one of your jobs, where you received little\\nformal training and were expected to learn “on-the-job” with little guidance. Or, you may have heard of\\nworkers who attend training sessions that seem to have little relevance to the jobs the workers perform (see the\\n“Up Close” feature).\\n174', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 173}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=' \\nClose\\n Why Do Some Organizations Give So Little Attention to\\nNew Employee Orientation and Training?\\nTraditionally, some organizations have tended to throw new employees into a work situation with only\\nminimal training and orientation, assuming that they will learn the job by observing and doing (Dipboye,\\n1997). In these instances, there appears to be a strong belief that the really good workers will distinguish\\nthemselves by their ability to adapt and survive.\\nOne reason for this “sink-or-swim” treatment of new employees is that employee training and\\norientation have not been very high priorities for many organizations, particularly smaller businesses and\\nrelatively new companies. These organizations are so preoccupied with basic survival—maintaining\\nproductivity rates and keeping the size and quality of the workforce constant—that \\ntraining (along with\\nother personnel considerations, such as a program of regular performance appraisals) is put on the back\\nshelf. When conditions stabilize and the company has grown or matured, these personnel functions may\\nbe given greater emphasis.\\nAnother reason for the absence of new employee training programs is the lack of assessment of\\ntraining needs (Dipboye, 1997). Many organizations are simply unaware of what new employees need\\n(and want) to know. Those who know the most about new employee training needs are probably the\\nfrontline supervisors, who observe first-hand the skill and knowledge deficiencies of new workers. For\\nsome reason, however, these training needs are not communicated to the upper-level decision makers. Of\\ncourse, it may not be helpful to ask the new workers about their needs; because they are new, they are\\nusually unaware of their training requirements. New workers may also not readily admit to certain skill\\nor knowledge deficiencies in an effort to appear that they are indeed competent. A related problem arises\\nwhen there is no sound evaluation of existing training programs, for it is unlikely that additional\\nresources will be allocated unless the benefits of such programs have been demonstrated. Finally,\\ninadequate training and orientation may be rooted in the belief that the best way for new workers to\\nlearn is by doing. Although on-the-job training can be effective, organizations need to consider its costs\\nfor new employees, such as reduced levels of production and potential damage to the product, the\\nequipment, or the workers. There are many hidden costs of poorly trained workers, including mistakes\\nsuch as damaged products or equipment, legal liability for those mistakes, employee injuries, and lost\\nproductivity, and these can run into the thousands of dollars for each poorly trained worker. Moreover,\\nworkers today want comprehensive training and development programs to improve their career success,\\nso poor or nonexistent training programs can lead to costly turnover.\\nA Model for Successful Training Programs\\nTheories and principles of learning should be taken into account in the design and implementation of any good\\nemployee training program. In addition, to be successful, training programs need to follow a structured, step-\\nby-step model (see \\nFigure 7.3\\n). A successful training program should begin by \\nassessing training needs\\n. In\\nother words, the organization must first have some idea of what workers need to know to perform their jobs.\\nThe next step is \\nestablishing training objectives\\n—goals for what the training is supposed to accomplish.\\nTraining objectives need to be specific and related to measurable outcomes because training objectives are used\\nboth to set a course for the training program and to help later in determining if the training was indeed\\nsuccessful (Goldstein & Ford, 2002).\\nThe next step in the training program involves the \\ndevelopment and testing of training materials\\n. A variety\\nof factors must be taken into account in developing training \\nmaterials, such as the trainees’ educational and\\nskill levels, whether the training material focuses on the areas that are directly related to successful job\\nperformance, and what training methods will provide the best cost–benefit trade-off.

Important\\nconsiderations in implementing the training program include when and how often the training will take place,\\nwho will conduct the training, the assignment of trainees to sessions, and where the training will be conducted.\\nThe final step is the \\nevaluation of the training program\\n to determine if the training was effective. This step\\ninvolves a detailed analysis of whether training objectives were met and whether the training translates into\\ntrainees using the newly learned behaviors on the job.\\nLet’s look more closely at some of the issues related to successful personnel training programs, starting with\\na discussion of training needs assessment.\\nAssessing Training Needs\\nA successful training program should begin by assessing training needs (Ferreira, da Silva Abbad, & Mourao,\\n2015). In other words, the organization must have some idea of what workers need to know to perform their\\njobs. Typically, an assessment of training needs should include analyses on many levels: the organizational\\nlevel (the needs and goals of the organization), the task level (the requirements for performing the task), and\\nthe person level (the skills and knowledge required to do the job). An additional analysis can be done at the\\ndemographic level (determining training needs for specific demographic groups).\\nStop \\n&\\n Review\\nList and define four key issues that are important in determining the success of training programs.\\nOrganizational Analysis\\nThe organizational level of needs analysis considers issues such as the long- and short-term organizational\\ngoals and their implications for training, the available training resources, and the general climate for training\\n(that is, the workers’ and supervisors’ commitment to participation in the training program). In addition,\\norganizational analysis considers training needs that are the result of internal and external factors affecting the\\norganization. For example, the introduction of a new manufacturing system and technology would require the\\norganization to plan the kinds of technical skills, managerial skills, and support that workers will need to use\\nthe new machines and processes (Kozlowski & Salas, 1997; Salas & Cannon-Bowers, 2001). Similarly, a sales\\norganization’s decision to provide greater emphasis on customer service might require the development of new\\ntraining programs. In an organizational analysis, a strategy for assessing the training climate might involve\\nsurveying employees regarding their perceptions of training needs and their attitudes toward participation in\\ntraining programs. The organizational level of \\nneeds analysis would also want to determine whether managers’\\nexpectations regarding training needs were consistent with organizational goals.\\n176', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 175}),\n",

(As you may recall from \\nChapter 3\\n, a job analysis is\\nthe starting point for just about any personnel operation.) The next and most difficult step involves translating\\nthe specific task requirements of the job into the basic components of knowledge and skill that can be\\nincorporated into a training program.

       " Document(page_content='Person Analysis\\nThe person analysis of employee training needs examines the current capabilities of the workers themselves to\\ndetermine who needs what sort of training. Person analysis usually relies on worker deficiencies outlined in\\nperformance appraisals for incumbent workers and information derived from employee selection data, such as\\nscreening tests for new workers. Another important source of information is job incumbents’ self-assessments\\nof training needs (Ford & Noe, 1987), which may also help build employee commitment to the training\\nprogram.\\nThe use of the three levels of training needs analysis—organizational, task, and person—can help determine\\nwhich workers need training in which areas and provide information to guide the development of specific\\ntraining techniques. It has been argued that effective training programs should be based on an analysis of\\ntraining needs on many levels, rather than simply focusing on one level of analysis (Ostroff & Ford, 1989). In\\naddition, the organization must consider the impact of a proposed training program in terms of both the\\npotential benefits, such as increased efficiency and productivity, and the potential costs of the program itself.\\nDemographic Analysis\\nIt has been suggested that training needs analysis may have to be conducted on a fourth level, demographic\\nanalysis (Latham, 1988). A demographic analysis involves \\ndetermining the specific training needs of various\\ndemographic groups, such as women and men, certain ethnic minorities, and workers of different age brackets.\\nFor example, a study of the perceived training needs of workers 40 years of age and older found that the\\nyounger workers (aged 40 to 49 years) believed that they needed training in management skills, and the\\nmiddle-aged group (aged 50 to 59 years) preferred training in technological skills, whereas the oldest group (60\\nyears and older) showed little interest in any type of training, perhaps because they felt that they had little to\\ngain from additional training (Tucker, 1985). We will discuss training for special groups later in the chapter.\\nEstablishing Training Objectives\\nThe second step, after assessing needs, in a successful training program is establishing training objectives. As\\nmentioned earlier, it is important that objectives be specific and that they be associated with measurable\\noutcomes. Training objectives should specify what the trainee should be able to accomplish on completion of\\nthe training program (Goldstein & Ford, 2002). For example, objectives for a training program for cashiers\\nmight be that the trainee will be able to operate and maintain the cash register and make change on completion\\nof training.\\nTraining objectives are important in guiding the design of the training program and the selection of training\\ntechniques and strategies.

This process leads to a refinement of the training materials and\\nimprovement in the program. Let’s look at some of the more common training materials and methods.\\nEmployee training methods can be grouped into two broad categories: the on-site methods, or those\\nconducted on the job site, and the off-site methods, or those conducted away from the actual workplace.\\nOn-Site Methods\\nOn-site training methods may be further divided into several categories, including on-the-job training,\\napprenticeship, vestibule training, and job rotation.\\nOn-the-job training\\n—One of the oldest and most widely used training methods, \\non-the-job training\\nconsists simply of putting an inexperienced worker in the work-place and having a more experienced worker\\nteach that person about the job. This technique thus relies on principles of modeling, with the experienced\\nworker serving as the role model. Also, because actual hands-on learning is involved, the worker can receive\\nimmediate feedback, be reinforced for successful efforts, and have a chance to learn how to correct errors.\\nOn-the-Job Training\\n an employee training method of placing a worker in the workplace to learn\\nfirsthand about a job\\nThe popularity of on-the-job training is obvious because it requires little preparation and has few costs to\\nthe organization, aside from the time invested by the experienced worker. Moreover, because the trainee is\\nactually working while learning, certain small levels of output offset the costs of the supervising worker’s time.\\nHowever, problems occur when the organization neglects to consider the abilities and motivations of the\\nexperienced workers who serve as trainers. If these trainers do not see the personal benefits of serving as\\ntrainers (especially when there are no obvious benefits!), they will not be motivated to do a good job. Also,\\nbeing a good trainer requires certain qualities, such as patience and an ability to communicate. If the trainer\\nlacks these characteristics, this can interfere with trainees’ learning. For example, one study found that\\nexperienced trainers often presented ideas abstractly or spoke “over the heads” of trainees (Hinds, Patterson, &\\nPfeffer, 2001). Problems can also arise if the trainer does not know or follow proper work procedures. In this\\ncase, the trainer may teach the new worker wrong or inefficient methods.\\nStop \\n&\\n Review\\nDescribe the four levels of training needs analysis. Apprenticeship\\n a training technique, usually\\nlasting several years, that combines on-the-job experience with classroom instruction\\nOn-the-job training is best used when the trainers have been carefully selected because of their ability to\\nteach and when they have received systematic training to help them be more effective. Trainers should also\\nreceive some type of reward or recognition for performing their training duties, and the best trainers tend to be\\ncommitted and take pride in the work they do (Choi, Chan & Jacobs, 2015). Finally, the organization must\\naccept the fact that during the on-the-job training period, production rates will suffer. It is impossible to expect\\nthe trainer–trainee team to do a good job of training while simultaneously maintaining high output rates. It\\nhas been suggested that to be effective, on-the-job training should be used with other training methods,\\nincluding off-site methods such as seminars and programmed instruction (Wexley & Latham, 1991).\\nApprenticeship\\n—Skilled trade professions, such as carpentry, printing, masonry, and plumbing, use a very\\nold type of training program called apprenticeship. A typical \\napprenticeship\\n can last for several years and\\nusually combines some supervised on-the-job training experience (usually at least 2,000 hours) with classroom\\n179', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 178}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='instruction. The on-the-job experience allows the apprentice to learn the mechanics of the profession, whereas\\nthe classroom training usually teaches specific cognitive skills and rules and regulations associated with the\\nprofession (Harris, Simons, Willis, & Carden, 2003). \\nFor example, an apprentice in the housing construction\\nindustry will learn the mechanical skills of building a house while on the job and will learn about building\\ncodes and how to read blueprints in the classroom. The obvious advantage of apprenticeship programs is the\\ndetailed, long-term nature of the learning process. There is good evidence of the business benefits of\\napprenticeships in terms of increased productivity and lowered turnover (Kenyon, 2005).\\nIt is important to mention that the term \\napprenticeship\\n has been used to describe a number of training\\nprograms that are quite different from traditional, formal apprenticeships. These informal “apprenticeships”\\nmight be better labeled “mentorships,” because they typically do not have the strict combination of hands-on\\nlearning and classroom training required by formal apprenticeships. We will discuss mentoring a bit later\\nwhen we look at the use of mentoring in managerial training.\\nVestibule training\\n—\\nVestibule training\\n is another on-site training method. This method uses a separate\\ntraining area adjacent to the actual work area to simulate that setting, complete with comparable tools and\\nequipment. In vestibule training, professional trainers teach the new workers all aspects of the job, allowing\\nthem hands-on experience in the work simulation area. The main advantage of vestibule training is that there\\nis no disruption of actual production, because trainers rather than experienced workers provide instruction,\\nand the novice workers are not in the actual work setting. The major drawback to this method is its costs in\\nterms of the trainers, space, and equipment needed. In recent years, some large supermarkets have set up\\nvestibule training areas at closed check-out stations to teach prospective checkers how to operate laser scanners\\nand cash registers to ring up goods. Vestibule training is used to eliminate the delays to customers that\\ninevitably occur when using on-the-job training.\\nVestibule Training\\n training that uses a separate area adjacent to the work area to simulate the actual\\nwork setting\\nJob rotation\\n—A final on-site training method is \\njob rotation\\n, in which workers are rotated among a variety\\nof jobs, spending a certain length of time (usually several weeks to two months) at each. The basic premise\\nbehind job rotation is to expose workers to as many areas of the organization as possible so they can gain a\\ngood knowledge of its workings and how the various jobs and departments fit together. Job rotation can also\\nbe beneficial to the organization because of “cross-training” of workers. Thus, if a worker is absent or quits,\\nanother worker has already been trained to perform the job. Most commonly, job rotation is used to help\\nentry-level management personnel find the positions for which they are best suited. It can also be used to\\ngroom managers for higher-level positions, presumably making them more effective by enabling them to see\\nthe organization from a variety of perspectives. Research has shown that job rotation not only increases\\nlearning, but it also has positive effects on employees’ career progression and development (Campion,\\nCheraskin, & Stevens, 1994; Ortega, 2001). Job rotation has also been used in various team approaches to work-\\ntask design to increase worker flexibility, eliminate boredom, and increase worker job satisfaction and\\ncommitment to the organization (Wexley & Latham, 2001). For example, studies of nurses in Japan found that\\njob rotation allowed the nurses to understand more about their hospitals and their organizations’ missions,\\nleading to greater commitment to their jobs and hospitals.\\nJob Rotation\\n a method of rotating workers among a variety of jobs to increase their breadth of\\nknowledge\\nIt is important to mention, however, that job rotation does not consist of simply moving workers from task\\nto task with little or no preparation.

Because of the\\ngreater flexibility and control over the situation they afford, off-site methods are more varied and diverse than\\nthe on-site techniques. We will consider several off-site methods: seminars/webinars, audiovisual instruction,\\nbehavior modeling training, simulation techniques, programmed instruction, and computer-assisted\\ninstruction.\\nSeminars/Webinars\\n—A common method of employee training, and one that is likely familiar to students,\\nis the \\nseminar\\n, which typically involves some expert providing job-related information orally in a classroom-\\nlike setting. An online form of seminar, or \\nwebinar\\n, allows for greater reach to workers in multiple locations,\\ntypically with an opportunity to ask questions live or via online text. Although these methods of training allow\\na large number of workers to be trained simultaneously at relatively low cost, there are some drawbacks. First,\\nbecause the seminar/webinar is primarily a one-way form of communication, employees may not become\\nhighly involved in the learning process. Also, it is unclear whether workers will be able to translate the\\ninformation they receive from seminars/webinars into an actual performance of work behaviors. Finally, the\\nseminar/webinar method is often only as good as the presenter. A training program presented by a speaker\\nwho is unprepared and speaks in a monotone is unlikely to lead to any significant learning. In fact, one early\\nstudy found that the seminar was one of the least effective of various employee training methods (Carroll,\\nPaine, & Ivancevich, 1972). On a more positive note, however, seminar methods of instruction have been\\nshown to be an effective learning strategy, particularly when used with more educated workers, such as when\\nseminars are used in managerial and leadership training (Avolio, Reichard, Hannah, Walumbwa, & Chan, 2009;\\nBurke & Day, 1986). Another study found a positive impact of an employee health promotion program on\\nhealthful behaviors of employees and reduced absenteeism (Mills, Kessler, Cooper, & Sullivan, 2007). Of course,\\nseminars and webinars can be made even more effective if the lecture presentation is combined with question-\\nand-answer periods or audience discussion to encourage a more “active” learning process.\\nSeminar\\n a common training method in which an expert provides job-related information in a classroom-\\nlike setting\\nWebinar\\n an online training method similar to a lecture or seminar\\nAudiovisual Instruction\\n the use of pre-recorded videotapes and other electronic media to convey\\ntraining material\\nAudiovisual instruction\\n—\\nAudiovisual instruction\\n uses videos to train workers. In effect, audiovisual\\ninstruction is a seminar or webinar provided in a pre-recorded format—this would include training podcasts.\\nAlthough there may be some fairly \\nlarge initial costs for purchase or development of training materials, the\\naudiovisual method can be even more cost effective than traditional seminar or techniques if large numbers of\\nemployees are going to be trained.\\nAs in seminars or webinars, the quality of audiovisual instruction determines its effectiveness as a training\\ntool. In many instances, a video can be more entertaining than a seminar and may do a better job of attracting\\nthe audience’s attention. An obvious problem occurs, however, when the informational content is sacrificed for\\nentertainment value.\\nAudiovisual presentations are especially effective when the information is presented visually rather than\\nverbally. A few minutes of video can visually demonstrate manual operations (with instant replay, stop action,\\n181', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 180}),\n",

Moreover, the pre-recorded nature of audiovisual programs can ensure\\nuniformity of training by exposing all workers to the same information. For example, one company has\\nprepared a video presentation giving new employees information about company policies, procedures, and\\nemployee rights and benefits in a thorough, graphic, and cost-effective manner.\\nBehavior modeling training\\n—Another employee training technique is behavior modeling training (Decker\\n& Nathan, 1985; Goldstein & Sorcher, 1974). In \\nbehavior modeling training,\\n which is based on social learning\\ntheory, trainees are exposed to videotaped or live role models displaying both appropriate and inappropriate\\nwork behaviors as well as their successful or unsuccessful outcomes. Trainees are then allowed an opportunity\\nto try to replicate and practice the positive work behaviors. Research indicates that behavior modeling training,\\nif used correctly, can effectively improve employee job performance (Mann & Decker, 1984; Meyer & Raich,\\n1983; Taylor, Russ-Eft, & Chan, 2005). Behavior modeling training was also shown to be effective in computer\\nsoftware training (Gist, Schwoerer, & Rosen, 1989) and in training U.S. government employees for working in\\nJapan (Harrison, 1992). In another interesting study, behavior modeling training was found to be more effective\\nthan either seminars or programmed instruction (see discussion later in the chapter) in training computer\\noperators (Simon & Werner, 1996). Recent research suggests that for learning complex tasks, even behavior\\nmodeling training needs to be followed up to ensure that the training transfers to the actual work setting (May\\n& Kahnweiler, 2000). Behavior modeling may be a particularly effective strategy for ethics training, where\\nmodels can demonstrate complex ethical and moral decision making and actions (Kaptein, 2011a).\\nBehavior Modeling Training\\n a training method that exposes trainees to role models performing\\nappropriate and inappropriate work behaviors and their outcomes and then allows trainees to practice\\nmodeling the appropriate behaviors\\nSimulation techniques\\n—\\nSimulation training\\n is a method of replicating job conditions to instruct\\nemployees in proper work operations without actually putting them in the job setting. Jet pilots, astronauts,\\nand nuclear power plant operators are all subjected to intensive simulation training before they are allowed to\\ncontrol the complex and dangerous machinery that they will operate on the job. Simulation training allows the\\nworker hours of practice under conditions that are quite similar to the actual work setting, without allowing\\nthe possibility of damaging the equipment, the product, the environment, or themselves.\\nSimulation Training\\n training that replicates job conditions without placing the trainee in the actual work\\nsetting\\nFigure 7.4\\n At an insurance company’s training facility, claims adjusters are given audiovisual instruction as well as hands-on experience.\\n182', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 181}),\n",

Other\\nsimulations may be designed to give trainees exposure to what would normally be very hazardous working\\nconditions. For example, a Southern California police department has constructed a mock city (complete with a\\nbank and a convenience store!) for use in training police personnel in simulated emergency conditions. Police\\ntrainees attempt to foil simulated robbery attempts and rescue hostages from terrorists using the mock city and\\nblank ammunition. According to the police authorities, the realism of this simulation has led to better\\npreparation of new officers in dealing with actual life-threatening situations. As you can imagine, simulation\\ntraining is often quite expensive. However, the chance for hands-on experience, immediate feedback, and\\nrepeated practice makes it a highly effective technique.\\nWeb-based training\\n—More and more, employee training is being done virtually through Web-based,\\ninteractive programs, including the previously discussed webinars and podcasts (Gurtner, 2015). Some time\\nago, Whalen and Wright (2000) argued that much of future training will be Web-based due to the flexibility\\nand scope of the training programs that can be delivered via the Web, the convenience of having training “on\\ndemand” when employees need it, and the relatively low cost of Web-based training in comparison to “live”\\nemployee training programs. For example, a Web-based health promotion training program was found to have\\npositive effects on employee health, but at a much lower cost than a live training program (Williams & Day,\\n2011).\\nWeb-based training has incorporated an older form of learning known as \\nprogrammed instruction.\\nProgrammed instruction\\n involves the use of self-paced individualized training. Each trainee is provided\\nwith either printed materials or, more commonly, Web-based content to learn and then answers a series of\\nquestions that test how much learning has taken place. When test answers are substantially correct, the trainee\\nis instructed to move on to the next unit. If the questions are answered incorrectly, some review of the\\nprevious unit is required. Most of the student study guides that accompany college textbooks are examples of\\nprogrammed instruction.\\nProgrammed Instruction\\n self-paced individualized training in which trainees are provided with training\\nmaterials and can test how much they have learned\\nThe benefits of programmed instruction are that it is efficient because individuals proceed at their own paces\\nand that it provides immediate feedback. In addition, programmed instruction is an “active,” involved form of\\nlearning. Furthermore, although the development of such programs is time consuming, the initial cost\\ndiminishes greatly over time if large numbers of employees are trained. A problem can arise, however, in\\nkeeping the programs up to date, especially in fields where there are rapid changes in technology or in the\\ntypes of products produced or services performed, requiring that new instruction programs be continually\\ncreated.\\nComputer-assisted instruction\\n (CAI) is a more sophisticated approach to individualized employee training.\\nAlthough CAI is actually a form of programmed instruction, CAI systems offer the flexibility to change and\\nupdate the instructional programs continually. CAI also allows for immediate testing of the trainee’s learning\\nbecause the computer can ask questions and instantly score the correctness of responses, automatically\\nreturning the trainee to the earlier lesson if the answers are incorrect and quickly presenting the next unit\\nwhen the answers are correct (recall the computer-adaptive and Web-based testing discussed in \\nChapter 5\\n).\\nTypically, training organizations offer Web-based courses that can also generate detailed data on each trainee’s\\nperformance across all the lessons. One problem with individualized instruction such as CAI is that some\\nemployees may not have the self-motivation to learn and may do better in formal, “live” training programs\\n(Brown, 2001).\\n183', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 182}),\n",

With these programs, a trainee may be presented with a\\nvideo representation of a work situation. The computer then asks questions about which course of action the\\ntrainee would like to take. The response is then used to choose the next video segment, where the trainee can\\nsee the results of the choice played out. One such program used for management training exposes the trainee to\\na variety of difficult interpersonal and decision-making situations. The trainee is brought into a simulated\\nwork situation with actors portraying the roles of coworkers. In one setting, the trainee might need to deal\\nwith a subordinate who is angry about having been given a negative performance appraisal. In another\\nsituation, the trainee may be asked to play the role of leader of a decision-making group and choose one of\\nseveral possible courses of action. Choosing the correct management strategies leads to a positive outcome. If\\nan incorrect choice is made, the trainee will view the disastrous results played out in the subsequent scene.\\nThere has also been some use of online gaming platforms to develop teams—putting team members through\\nsimulated environments in order to build coordination and cooperation among team members. We will discuss\\nteam training in \\nChapter 12\\n. As the Millennial generation becomes more prominent in the workforce, it is\\nlikely that we will see a large increase in Web-based training, including the use of gaming platforms for\\ntraining (Grossman, Heyne, & Salas, 2015). For example, in one study it was found that a gaming-based\\ntraining led to better employee performance than employees trained through nongamified training (Alcivar &\\nAbad, 2016).\\nManagement/Leadership Training Methods\\nBecause managers and organizational leaders are considered to play such a central role in administrative\\nfunctions, coordinating organizational activities and motivating workers, and because managerial skills are\\nabstract and difficult to learn, a large share of training resources goes into the training and development of\\nmanagers. In fact, a variety of special techniques are used almost exclusively in management training.\\nOne common and popular management training technique is the \\nproblem-solving case study\\n, which\\npresents trainees with a written description of a real or hypothetical organizational problem. Each trainee is\\nallowed time to study the case individually and come up with a solution. The trainees then meet in small\\ngroups to present and critique their solutions and discuss the problem further. One purpose of such studies is to\\nshow trainees that there are no single or easy solutions to complex problems (Berger, 1983). Another goal is to\\nhelp trainees develop skills in diagnosing and dealing with organizational problems. Although the problem-\\nsolving case study is a popular management training method, some doubt its effectiveness (Argyris, 1980;\\nCampbell, Dunnette, Lawler, & Weick, 1970), specifically whether the learning from the hypothetical situation\\ntransfers well to actual management situations.\\nProblem-Solving Case Study\\n a management training technique that presents a real or hypothetical\\norganizational problem that trainees attempt to solve\\nAn extension of this method is to have trainees engage in \\nrole-playing\\n a certain management situation. For\\nexample, in a role-playing exercise to develop managers’ abilities to handle difficult interpersonal situations, a\\ntrainer may play a subordinate who has chronic performance problems. The trainee plays the manager, and the\\ntrainer may later offer feedback concerning how the situation was handled. In role-playing the basic idea is\\nthat trainees will become more involved in a problem situation if they act it out. Sometimes, participants will\\nreverse roles to gain a different perspective on the problem situation.

They are in many ways similar to some of the more complicated board or\\ncomputer simulation games that people play at home. One example is called “Tinsel Town,” \\nwhere trainees\\nfunction as the top management team of a fictional movie studio (Devine, Habig, Martin, Bott, & Grayson,\\n2004). Participants may either play in groups, forming management teams to compete against other teams, or\\nplay against one another individually. As with case studies, the difficulty is in generalizing learning from the\\ngame situation to the actual work setting. Also, participants may become so caught up in the game that they do\\nnot comprehend the management principles that are being taught. An early review of research on management\\ngames, however, indicated that they are an effective management training technique (Keys & Wolfe, 1990).\\nAnother management training technique is the \\nconference\\n, or group discussion. Conferences usually\\ninvolve a highly unstructured type of training in which participants are brought together to share ideas and\\ninformation and solve some shared management problems. The basic goal of conferences is for practicing\\nmanagers to learn effective management techniques that have been used by other managers. Their main\\nadvantage is that they encourage individual participation in the learning process. As mentioned, full-scale\\ntraining programs usually include a number of training methods. This is particularly true in management\\ntraining, in which trainees may attend workshops lasting several days, with participants exposed to training in\\na variety of areas, including problem solving, decision making, and interpersonal skills, using a number of\\ntechniques.\\nConference\\n an unstructured management training technique in which participants share ideas,\\ninformation, and problems; also called a group discussion\\nAction learning\\n, a highly complex, involved type of managerial training/development, consists of teams of\\nemployees who are assembled to work on a company-related problem or issue (Conger & Toegel, 2003;\\nMarquardt, Leonard, Freedman, & Hill, 2009). Rather than being a simulation, action learning has the team\\nworking on an actual assignment such as developing a new product or solving an organizational problem\\n(Conger & Xin, 2000; O’Neil & Marsick, 2014). The concept behind action learning is that managers learn by\\ndoing, whereas the organization benefits from the results of the action learning team’s project. For example,\\naction learning teams at General Electric have been formed to deal with issues as diverse as investigating\\nmarkets for leasing locomotive engines, developing new applications for plastic in the design of automobile\\nbodies, and developing marketing plans for foreign markets—with the team members learning as they\\ncontribute to expanding GE’s businesses (Dotlich & Noel, 1998).

A 360-degree feedback can be\\nan effective management development tool, but only if the manager is open to and accepting of the potentially\\ncritical feedback (Fletcher, 2015; Waldman & Bowen, 1998). Atwater, Brett, and Waldman (2003) suggest that\\n360-degree feedback will be most successful when participants are trained in the technique, when feedback is\\nhonest and constructive, when the feedback is combined with other training efforts so that the manager can\\nsee how to improve performance, and when there is careful follow-up monitoring and feedback. As in all types\\nof training, there are individual differences. Some managers may react favorably to 360-degree feedback, but\\nothers may not benefit and may have a negative reaction (Atwater, Waldman, Atwater, & Cartier, 2000). A\\nlongitudinal study of managers who received 360-degree feedback suggested that the technique led to\\nimproved managerial competence over time (Bailey & Fletcher, 2002).\\nAn increasingly popular training program for new managers that combines elements of on-the-job training\\nand a sort of informal “apprenticeship” is \\nmentoring\\n, a process by which an inexperienced worker develops a\\nrelationship with an experienced worker to promote the former’s career development (Allen & Eby, 2007).\\nMuch of the learning that takes place in these relationships involves the protégé attempting to imitate the\\nmentor’s work and interpersonal style. Modeling thus appears to be one key learning process in mentoring.\\nMentoring among managers in large organizations is becoming more and more common as young,\\ninexperienced workers typically look to older, more experienced workers to help them to “learn the ropes” of\\nthe job (Kram & Hall, 1989; Ragins, Cotton, & Miller, 2000). It has even been suggested that women executives\\nwill have difficulty moving up the corporate ladder unless they receive some mentoring from higher-ups\\n(Ragins, 1999).\\nMentoring\\n a training program in which an inexperienced worker develops a relationship with an\\nexperienced worker who serves as an advisor\\nSince its appearance as a formal training strategy in the late 1970s (Roche, 1979), there has been extensive\\nresearch, as well as popular interest, in mentoring as a management training and development technique. For\\nthe most part, there are many positive results of good mentoring relationships. For instance, protégés generally\\nadvance more quickly in their careers, have greater job and career satisfaction, and have lower turnover than\\nworkers without mentors (Allen, Finkelstein, & Poteet, 2009; Ragins, 1999). Of course, a mentoring program is\\nonly going to be successful if there are good relationships between mentors and protégés (Young & Perrewé,\\n2000), and mentoring programs using more “powerful,” senior mentors seem to be more effective than peer\\nmentoring programs (Ensher, Thomas, & Murphy, 2001). Research, however, suggests that mentoring\\nrelationships that develop on their own, informally, are typically more successful than formal, assigned\\nmentoring relationships (Raabe & Beehr, 2003; Scandura & Williams, 2001). Research has also indicated that a\\nnumber of factors may influence workers’ willingness to serve as mentors. For instance, managers are more\\nwilling to mentor newer workers if those workers show greater promise and if they are more similar to the\\nmentor in terms of factors such as educational background (Burke, McKeen, & McKenna, 1993; Olian, Carroll,\\n& Giannantonio, 1993). Gender may also play a part in willingness to mentor (Ragins & Cotton, 1993), with\\nwomen less likely than men to volunteer as mentors, particularly if the protégé is a man.\\nMentoring as a management development technique is quite popular in organizations today (\\nFigure 7.5\\n).\\nAlthough the benefits of mentorship to protégés are obvious, there are also some payoffs for the mentor and\\nfor the organization (Fagenson, 1989). The mentor, who may be at a midlife career standstill, may become\\nenergized by the chance to assist in the development of an eager young worker’s career. The organization also\\nbenefits, because mentoring leads to a more well-trained and satisfied young workforce. On the other hand,\\nmentors may find mentoring time consuming and burdensome (Ragins, 1989; Ragins & Scandura, 1993).\\n186', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 185}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Evaluation of the Training Program\\nA crucial component of any employee training program is the evaluation of training effectiveness, for there is\\nno use in investing money and resources in training programs unless they do indeed work. Despite its\\nimportance, however, relatively few programs are actually subjected to rigorous evaluation (Birati & Tziner,\\n1999; Goldstein & Ford, 2002). Sometimes, training programs are not evaluated because the organization’s\\ntrainers lack the expertise to conduct the evaluations or the administration does not support evaluation efforts\\n(Marshall & Rossett, 2014).\\nThe evaluation of a training program should first outline the criteria that indicate the program’s success and\\ndevelop the means for measuring these criteria. One very useful framework suggests that there are four types\\nof criteria for evaluating a program’s effectiveness (Kirkpatrick, 1959–1960; Latham & Saari, 1979; Warr, Allan,\\n& Birdi, 1999):\\n1\\n. \\nReaction criteria\\n—measures the impressions of trainees, including their assessments of the\\nprogram’s value, the amount of learning they received, and their enjoyment of the program. Reaction\\ncriteria are usually assessed via training evaluation rating surveys given to trainees immediately after\\ntraining sessions or workshops. It is important to note that reaction criteria do not measure whether\\nany learning has taken place. Rather, they assess trainees’ opinions about the training and their\\nlearning.\\n2\\n. \\nLearning criteria\\n—measures the amount of learning that has taken place. Typically, these take the\\nform of some sort of tests assessing the amount of information retained from the program.\\n3\\n. \\nBehavioral criteria\\n—measures the amount of newly learned skills displayed once the trainee has\\nreturned to the job. Observational methods of measurement are typically used to assess behavioral\\ncriteria, with supervisors recording the use of newly learned behaviors.\\n4\\n. \\nResults criteria\\n—measures the outcomes that are important to the organization, such as increased\\ntrainee work output as expressed by production rates, dollar sales figures, or quality of work. Using\\nthe results criteria, a cost–benefit analysis can be performed by comparing the costs of the program\\nto the dollar value of the results. This is usually the most important evaluation of a program’s\\neffectiveness. However, it is sometimes difficult to translate training outcomes into dollars and cents.\\nFor example, if one of the goals is to improve employee attitudes, it may be hard to place a dollar\\nvalue on such results.\\nThe important question in the evaluation of programs is whether any measured changes in criteria are indeed\\nthe result of training. The methods used in the proper evaluation of a training program are those used to\\ndetermine the effectiveness of any other type of program introduced into an organization. For a formal\\nevaluation to demonstrate conclusively that training has caused certain outcomes, it should be based on\\nexperimental designs. Unfortunately, many evaluations use what might be called “pre-experimental designs,”\\nwhich do not allow for proper assessments (Campbell & Stanley, 1963)(see \\nFigure 7.6\\n). One example, the\\nposttest-only design\\n, simply measures criteria following the completion of a training program.

The simplest and most common experimental design for evaluation\\nresearch uses one training group and one control group, both of which are measured before and after the\\nprogram. To ensure that there are no unexpected differences in members of the training and control groups,\\nemployees are randomly assigned to the two groups. The pretest and posttest scores are then compared. This\\nexperimental design makes it clear that any positive changes in the criterion measures of the training group,\\nrelative to the control group, are most likely due to the training program.\\nA more sophisticated experimental design is the \\nSolomon four-group design\\n (Solomon, 1949). This method\\nof evaluation uses four groups, two that are trained and two that are not. In the Solomon design, two of the\\ngroups are identical to those in the basic experimental design mentioned earlier. That is, one training group\\nand one control group are measured both before and after the training program. However, the additional\\ntraining and control groups are measured only after the program, which is intended to help rule out the fact\\nthat administering a pretraining measure might sensitize employees to what the program is designed to do and\\nmight thus produce certain changes in the criterion measures that occur without the benefit of training. For\\nexample, if our bank tellers are given a pretraining test of their customer service knowledge, they might realize\\nthat management is very interested in this issue, which might cause all tellers to give greater attention to\\ncustomers, regardless of whether they later receive customer service training. Although the Solomon four-\\ngroup design is an effective design for evaluating training programs, it is underused, primarily because of the\\nlarge number of participants and groups required (Braver & Braver, 1988).\\nSolomon Four-Group Design\\n a method of program evaluation using two treatment groups and two\\ncontrol groups\\nThe Solomon four-group design can be used, however, for more than just an evaluation of training programs.\\nOne study used the design to evaluate employee reactions to a major organizational restructuring (Probst,\\n2003). \\nFigure 7.6\\n summarizes the various evaluation designs.\\nA comprehensive evaluation of a training program must be well designed and executed to ensure that the\\ntraining is indeed effective. This means careful consideration must be given to the selection and measurement\\nof criteria, an experimental design with adequate control groups must be used, and the costs versus benefits of\\nthe program must be assessed (Arvey, Maxwell, & Salas, 1992; Birati & Tziner, 1999).\\nAn obvious problem in evaluating the effectiveness of training programs is the inability to use a true\\nexperimental design due to constraints imposed by the particular work organizations. However, quasi-\\nexperimental designs can be used (Campbell & Stanley, 1963; Cook, Campbell, & Peracchio, 1991). As discussed\\nin \\nChapter 2\\n, quasi-experiments are approximations of experimental designs. One example is the\\nnonequivalent control group design.

One \\nexample was\\na training course for firefighters that demanded that trainees lift and carry a 150-pound dummy over their\\nshoulders for several yards or down a flight of stairs to simulate carrying an unconscious person from a\\nburning building.

Likewise, jobs are constantly changing in\\nterms of structure, technology, and tasks. Your job today might be completely different six months from\\nnow. As a result, I/O psychologists and human resources professionals are giving greater attention to\\ntraining the skills required in ever-changing jobs and work environments.\\nOne model suggests that the skills needed for adaptive performance include \\nsolving problems\\ncreatively\\n, \\ndealing with uncertain work situations, handling emergencies\\n, and \\nbeing interpersonally\\n and\\nculturally adaptable\\n (Pulakos, Arad, Donovan, & Plamondon, 2000). Other research suggests that\\neffective, adaptable workers need to develop what is called “proactive thinking,” which involves a\\nwillingness and ability to take action to change a situation to one’s advantage (Kirby, Kirby, & Lewis,\\n2002). There is evidence that both adaptive performance and proactive thinking can be trained.\\nOrganizations are realizing that the greatest source of information and ingenuity is in the company’s\\nown employees. This is particularly true in technology-oriented organizations and companies that rely\\nheavily on innovation (think Silicon Valley). As a result, training employees to use and manage the\\nknowledge already existing in the company—knowledge management—is becoming popular (Nisula &\\nKianto, 2016). Another approach is to develop workers to be more entrepreneurial and innovative. This\\napproach is labeled “agile management” (Adkins, 2010) and involves developing employees to behave like\\nentrepreneurs—to try new ideas and nurture those that look promising, but quickly abandon those that\\naren’t working and move on to another innovative idea (i.e., to learn to “fail quickly”).\\nAnother area that is receiving a great deal of attention is training workers to be more creative. Special\\nattention has been given to developing creative and innovative workers and organizational leaders (Birdi,\\n2007; Mumford & Licuanan, 2004). A meta-analysis of 70 studies suggests that creativity training is\\ngenerally effective in getting people to be more creative and innovative in approaching tasks (Scott,\\nLeritz, & Mumford, 2004). In all likelihood, work-related training in the future will focus more on\\nstrategies to be creative and adaptive, rather than learning specific tasks and procedures.\\nSummary\\n192', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 191}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Employee training\\n is a planned effort by an organization to facilitate the learning, retention, and transfer of\\njob-related behavior. Training is not limited to new employees, but often involves various types of training and\\ndevelopment programs offered throughout an employee’s career. Specific areas of employee training include\\nnew employee orientation; employee retraining and continuing education; retirement planning and career\\ndevelopment; and worker training for international assignments, for diversity, to reduce sexual harassment,\\nand to increase ethical behavior at work.\\nAn understanding of learning theories is fundamental in the design of employee training programs. For\\nexample, the concept of \\nmodeling\\n, which is imitative of learning, is expressed in \\nsocial learning theory\\n. If\\ntraining programs are to be successful, a number of key issues will affect their effectiveness. For example,\\ntransfer of training\\n, or how the learning translates into use of the newly learned behaviors, and the job\\ncharacteristics of the trainees, such as \\ntrainee readiness\\n, must be taken into account. Finally, concern must be\\ngiven to how training programs are structured and how they are conducted.\\nThe first step in a successful employee training program is assessing training needs, which occurs on several\\nlevels. Organizational analysis considers the organization’s goals, resources, and the climate for training; task\\nanalysis evaluates the specific knowledge, skills, and abilities that a job requires; and person analysis examines\\nthe capabilities and deficiencies of the workers themselves. Training needs may also have to be conducted\\nthrough demographic analysis, which is targeted toward assessing the training needs of specific groups, such as\\nmales versus females or the old versus the young. The second step involves establishing training objectives,\\nwhereas the third step focuses on employee training methods. The various training methods can be broken\\ndown into two general categories: onsite methods and offsite methods. Of onsite methods, \\non-the-job training\\nis the most widely used, consisting of putting inexperienced workers into the work site under the direction of\\nan experienced teacher-worker. \\nApprenticeship\\n is a much more long-term onsite method, combining classroom\\ntraining with supervised on-the-job training. \\nVestibule training\\n sets up a model training area adjacent to the\\nactual work site, using professional trainers and hands-on experience. \\nJob rotation\\n is a training technique\\ndesigned to broaden workers’ experience by rotating employees among various jobs.\\nOff-site methods include the common \\nseminar\\n method and \\naudiovisual instruction\\n that provides graphic\\ndepictions of work activities and Web-based training (webinars). A technique that uses aspects of both\\naudiovisual technology and concepts of social learning theory is \\nbehavior modeling training\\n, a method of\\nexposing trainees to videotapes of models engaged in appropriate work behaviors and then having them\\npractice the observed behaviors. \\nSimulation techniques\\n involve classroom replications of actual workstations.\\nProgrammed instruction\\n is a form of self-paced training in which workers can learn at their own pace. A\\nsophisticated version of programmed instruction is \\ncomputer-assisted instruction (CAI).\\nSeveral specific methods and techniques used in management training include \\nproblem-solving case studies\\n,\\nrole-playing\\n, and \\nmanagement games\\n, which all involve simulations of actual management situations. \\nAction\\nlearning\\n is a complicated form of training in which teams are formed to perform a special project or\\nassignment that benefits the organization, while the team members learn and develop managerial skills. A 360-\\ndegree feedback is also used as a management development tool. \\nMentoring\\n is a management training program\\nin which an inexperienced worker is assigned to an experienced mentor who serves as a role model. \\nCoaching\\nis where a consultant advises an executive to improve performance.\\nOnce training programs have been implemented, the evaluation of their effectiveness is very important. The\\nfirst step in evaluation is to determine criteria of training effectiveness. Four types are typically used: reaction\\ncriteria, learning criteria, behavioral criteria, and results criteria. Once the criteria are established, basic\\nresearch methods and design should be used to evaluate the training programs. The \\npretest–posttest\\n design is a\\ncommon but inadequate means of assessing a program in which measures of criteria are collected both before\\nand after a training intervention, allowing for a comparison of changes in learning or work behaviors.\\nHowever, this method is inadequate because of the lack of a good comparison group. Better evaluation designs\\nuse both a training group and a comparison, or control, group that is not subjected to the training program. A\\ncomplex and sophisticated evaluation design is the \\nSolomon four-group design\\n, which uses two training groups\\nand two control groups.\\nFinally, certain legal issues must be considered in the design and implementation of training programs.\\nTraining or educational prerequisites and the training programs themselves must not unfairly discriminate on\\nthe basis of ethnicity, age, sex, or disability.\\n193', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 192}),\n",

A great deal of effort went into finding the position, making it\\nthrough the screening process, and landing the job and in your initial training and orientation. You’ve learned\\nthe ropes and know what to do. There are a lot of positive aspects to the job, but it’s not all rosy. Your attitudes\\nand evaluation of your working situation will determine if you stay in this job, with this company, and even\\non this career path. We work partly out of necessity, but we stay in a job or an organization because of the\\npositive things that come from the job, the company, and the career.\\nSeventy-five years ago, the only compensation that most workers received from their jobs was a paycheck.\\nAs time went on, this changed as workers began to demand and receive more from their jobs. Today’s workers\\nreceive a variety of forms of compensation, including health care, retirement, and numerous other benefits and\\nprograms. However, one thing that the workers of the past and today’s workers have in common is that their\\njobs constitute a major part of their lives and are one of the greatest sources of personal pleasure and pain.\\nAlthough jobs can be satisfying in some ways, with positive feelings of accomplishment and purpose, they can\\nalso be stressful and the source of negative feelings. Such negative feelings may, in turn, affect worker attitudes\\nand behaviors.\\nIn the next two chapters we will explore the positive and negative effects of jobs on workers. In this chapter\\nwe will focus on employee engagement, including job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and positive\\nemployee attitudes and behaviors. We will examine how these influence work performance, absenteeism, and\\nturnover. We will also focus on some of the programs and techniques designed to increase employees’\\nengagement in their work and their organizations. We will then focus on positive employee behaviors and how\\nwe can encourage the best from workers, for the good of the organization and for improving employee well-\\nbeing.\\nEmployee Engagement\\nEmployee engagement\\n is a psychological state that is characterized by vigor (energy), dedication, and\\nabsorption in one’s work and organization (Schaufeli, Salanova, Gonzalez-Roma, & Bakker, 2002). Highly\\nengaged employees are enthusiastic about their jobs, committed to their work and the organization, and it is\\nassumed that this state leads them to be more motivated, productive, and more likely to engage in positive\\nwork behaviors (Macey & Schneider, 2008). We will use employee engagement as an “umbrella” term to focus\\non positive employee attitudes, including the related (and much more thoroughly researched) constructs of job\\nsatisfaction and organizational commitment (Mackay, Allen, & Landis, 2016).\\nEmployee Engagement\\n a psychological state characterized by vigor, dedication, and absorption in one’s\\nwork/organization\\nWhat factors contribute to employee engagement? Saks (2006) suggests that jobs that are high in job\\ncharacteristics (recall the job characteristics model discussed in \\nChapter 8\\n) are more meaningful and more\\nlikely to engage employees. In addition, if the employees feel that they are supported by their supervisors and\\ntheir organization, they are more likely to experience high levels of engagement. Finally, being recognized and\\nrewarded for one’s accomplishments and working in an organization that treats people fairly, all contribute to\\nemployee engagement.\\nThe construct of employee engagement has received a great deal of attention from consultants and HR\\nprofessionals, but, until recently, has received less attention from researchers. It does, however, represent a\\nmore global way of looking at the positive attitudes and feelings of employees about their work and their work\\norganizations. One self-report measure of employee engagement assesses two separate, but related,\\ncomponents, \\njob engagement\\n (sample scale items: “Sometimes I am so into my job that I lose track of time” and\\n“I am highly engaged in this job”) and \\norganization engagement\\n (sample items: “Being a member of this\\norganization is very captivating” and “I am highly engaged in this organization”) (Saks, 2006).

       " Document(page_content='found that employee engagement was positively related to job satisfaction and negatively related to employees’\\nstated intentions to quit their jobs.\\nJob Satisfaction\\nAlthough job engagement is a broad construct that refers to how much employees are psychologically and\\nemotionally committed to their jobs and their organizations, it is a relatively new variable in I/O psychology. A\\nrelated variable—one that has been extensively studied—is job satisfaction.\\nJob Satisfaction\\n the positive and negative feelings and attitudes about one’s job\\nJob satisfaction\\n consists of the feelings and attitudes one has about one’s job. All aspects of a particular job,\\ngood and bad, positive and negative, are likely to contribute \\nto the development of feelings of satisfaction (or\\ndissatisfaction). As seen in \\nChapter 2\\n, job satisfaction, along with productivity, quality, absenteeism, and\\nturnover, is one of the key dependent variables commonly considered (and measured) in research in I/O\\npsychology. There are two approaches to conceptualizing job satisfaction. The first is the \\nglobal approach,\\nwhich considers overall job satisfaction. This way of looking at job satisfaction simply asks if the employee is\\nsatisfied overall, using a yes–no response, a single rating scale, or a small group of items that measure global\\njob satisfaction. The second is the \\nfacet approach,\\n which considers job satisfaction to be composed of feelings\\nand attitudes about a number of different elements, or facets, of the job. For example, overall satisfaction may\\nbe a composite of numerous factors: satisfaction with pay, the type of work itself, working conditions, the type\\nof supervision, company policies and procedures, relations with coworkers, and opportunities for promotion\\nand advancement. The facet approach considers each of these aspects individually, assuming that a particular\\nworker might be quite satisfied with some facet, such as the amount of pay, but unsatisfied with others, such as\\nthe quality of supervision and the opportunities for promotion.\\nGlobal Approach\\n views job satisfaction as an overall construct\\nFacet Approach\\n views job satisfaction as made up of individual elements, or facets\\nThere has been considerable discussion over which approach is better (High-house & Becker, 1993).\\nProponents of the global approach argue that it is overall satisfaction with a job that is important and that such\\ncomplete satisfaction is more than the sum of satisfaction with separate job facets (Scarpello & Campbell, 1983;\\nSchneider, 1985). Moreover, evidence suggests that even single-item measures of job satisfaction work\\nreasonably well for assessing job satisfaction (Wanous, Reichers, & Hudy, 1997). On the other hand, advocates\\nof the facet approach maintain that this view provides better and more detailed assessments of job satisfaction,\\nallowing a researcher insight into how a particular individual feels about the various facets of the job and the\\nwork situation. One or more facets may be the primary cause of lack of job satisfaction. Moreover, there may\\nbe tremendous variation in how highly individual workers value certain facets of job satisfaction (Rice, Gentile,\\n& McFarlin, 1991). For example, satisfaction with pay may be an important element of job satisfaction for one\\nworker but not for another. In addition, some facets may not apply to all types of jobs. For instance, CEOs of\\ncompanies and self-employed professionals are not affected by opportunities for promotion—a facet that may\\nbe an important contributor to job satisfaction of lower-level managers in large organizations.\\nProponents of the facet definition argue that it helps to indicate specific areas of dissatisfaction that can be\\ntargeted for improvement (Locke, 1976; Smith, Kendall, & Hulin, 1969). Still others believe there are advantages\\nto using both types of measurement approaches based on findings that indicate that each approach offers\\ninteresting and important information (Ironson, Smith, Bran-nick, Gibson, & Paul, 1989).

       " Document(page_content='psychological research on the topic utilizes the facet approach in the measurement of job satisfaction because\\nthere is a belief that job satisfaction is composed of a number of elements, not just one global evaluation.\\nThe Measurement of Job Satisfaction\\nRegardless of the approach, when considering the measurement of job satisfaction, it is important to bear in\\nmind the difficulties encountered in attempting to define the factors that may influence satisfaction, as well as\\nthe difficulties inherent in trying to measure any attitude.\\nAs mentioned earlier, most instruments designed from the facet approach measure satisfaction with such\\nthings as pay, working conditions, and relationships with supervisors and coworkers. However, other variables\\nsuch as pre-employment expectations, individual personality characteristics, and the fit between the\\norganization or job and the employee may also affect worker satisfaction (Ostroff, 1993a). Satisfaction with\\ncareer choice and the employee’s career progression can also contribute to job satisfaction (Scarpello &\\nVandenberg, 1992). Research has suggested that elements of job satisfaction may be deeply rooted in the\\nindividual workers. These researchers have suggested that there may be genetic “predispositions” to be satisfied\\nor dissatisfied with one’s job (see “On the Cutting Edge” box).\\nAlthough a variety of factors might contribute to job satisfaction for most workers (e.g., working conditions,\\nrelationships at work), as mentioned before, the connection between such factors and job satisfaction may not\\nbe a direct link. Job satisfaction may be moderated by the perceptions of individual workers (Gardner & Pierce,\\n1998; Mathieu, Hofmann, & Farr, 1993). This is because different employees may perceive the same job\\ndifferently, and it is those individual perceptions that determine whether or not an employee is satisfied with\\nthe job. For instance, improving the working environment may affect satisfaction for some employees, but not\\nfor others because not everyone is dissatisfied with the environment.\\nAnother major obstacle in the measurement of job satisfaction is the same obstacle encountered in the\\nmeasurement of any attitude—the necessary reliance on respondents’ self-reports. Recall that problems with\\nself-report measures include the fact that workers may (intentionally or unintentionally) fail to report their\\ntrue feelings. Strategies for measuring job satisfaction have included interviews, group meetings, and a variety\\nof structured survey methods, such as rating scales or questionnaires. The obvious advantages of using a rating\\nscale or questionnaire instead of a face-to-face meeting are the reduced time invested in the administration of\\nthe instrument and the fact that anonymity of responses can often be maintained (particularly if large numbers\\nof employees are being surveyed). Such anonymity may help to ensure that worker responses are more candid\\nthan they might be in a face-to-face interview. That is, some workers, fearing retaliation from management,\\nmay not give an accurate representation of their levels of job satisfaction in an interview or a meeting and may\\ntry to present an overly positive picture of their feelings.\\nOn the \\nCutting\\n Edge:\\nPersonality, Genetics, and Job Satisfaction\\nCan job satisfaction be a reality for all workers? And how much can the organization do toward\\nincreasing or maintaining job satisfaction for its workers? Although the organization can do much to\\nfoster job satisfaction, the factors that cause job satisfaction are not entirely under the control of the\\norganization. Workers can influence their own levels of job satisfaction through such actions as\\nperforming their jobs well and maintaining good attendance at work. Even if we could set up the ideal\\nworkplace, would this lead all workers to enjoy high levels of job satisfaction? Research on the influences\\nof personality and genetic factors on job satisfaction suggests that the answer is “no.”\\nFor example, workers who score high on personal alienation—indicating deep-set tendencies toward\\nfeeling isolated, lonely, and powerless—do not seem to be as affected by interventions designed to\\nincrease workers’ job satisfaction as are workers scoring low on this personality characteristic (Efraty &\\nSirgy, 1990). Persons high on negative affect/emotions, as well as persons prone to boredom, may also be\\nless likely to feel job satisfaction (Dormann, Fay, Zapf, & Frese, 2006; Kass, Vodanovich, & Callender,\\n226', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 225}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='2001). Moreover, personality differences may mean that workers will find different “sources” of job\\nsatisfaction in the workplace. For instance, workers with low self-esteem appear to find more satisfaction\\nin jobs in which expectations of performance are clear (e.g., there are clear guidelines for performance),\\nwhereas job satisfaction in persons with higher self-esteem is not as affected by knowledge of\\nperformance expectations (Pierce, Gardner, Dunham, & Cummings, 1993). Indications are that workers’\\npersonalities may vary in terms of the amount of job satisfaction they are able to achieve and under what\\nconditions they are best able to achieve it. In fact, it has been argued that dispositional factors may be\\nresponsible for the fact that surveys of U.S. workers during both good and bad economic times seem to\\nshow approximately the same percentages of satisfied and dissatisfied workers (Staw & Ross, 1985). In\\nother words, although economic conditions fluctuate, the distribution of different personality types in the\\nworkforce remains relatively stable.\\nPerhaps more interesting is the finding that genetic factors present at birth can influence a worker’s job\\nsatisfaction. Studies examining the genetic and environmental components of job satisfaction using\\nidentical twins who were reared apart in different homes found a higher correlation in the twin adults’\\njob satisfaction than would be found between persons in the general population (Arvey, Bouchard, Segal,\\n& Abraham, 1989; Keller, Bouchard, Arvey, Segal, & Dawis, 1992). In other words, despite the fact that the\\nidentical twins were raised in totally different environments and likely were in completely different job\\nenvironments, the twins’ levels of job satisfaction were quite similar. Research has discovered some of the\\ngenetic markers associated with job satisfaction (Song, Li, & Arvey, 2011) and with worker reactions to\\njobs and their overall well-being (Li, Zhang, Song, & Arvey, 2016).\\nOf course, such findings do not suggest that organizations have no responsibility in helping workers to\\nachieve job satisfaction. What these findings do suggest is that job satisfaction may not be completely\\ndetermined by characteristics of the organization or of the job (Dormann & Zapf, 2001). Although\\norganizations must provide an environment where employees can meet their job-related needs, they\\ncannot guarantee that every worker will achieve the same level of satisfaction. Likewise, workers should\\nnot place the entire responsibility for their own job satisfaction (and other work attitudes) on the\\nemployer.\\nOn the other hand, meetings or interviews can provide richer information because the interviewer can ask\\nfollow-up questions or request further elaboration or clarification of an answer. In addition, response biases\\n(e.g., tendencies for all or most employees to give overly positive or negative responses) and ambiguous items\\nthat employees may interpret differently may seriously damage the validity of a pencil-and-paper job\\nsatisfaction measure. Another problem with survey instruments is context effects (Harrison & McLaughlin,\\n1993). Context effects occur when a neutral item is responded to negatively or positively simply because it is\\ngrouped with other items that are worded negatively or positively. Finally, even well-designed, standardized\\ninstruments may become outdated and require periodic revisions due to changes in technology and work roles\\n(Roznowski, 1989). In summary, no matter which type of measurement is selected, careful thought and\\nplanning must go into the development and administration of job satisfaction measures.\\nStop \\n&\\n Review\\nDescribe the two approaches to conceptualizing job satisfaction.\\nDespite the complexities, many organizations develop their own interviews, scales, or surveys that are used\\nto measure employee job satisfaction. Although such in-house techniques can be designed to assess satisfaction\\nwith specific issues relevant to each company’s employees, their results may be difficult to interpret. First,\\nthese measures may not be reliable or valid. To construct measures that are reliable and valid, one must have a\\nrather extensive background in survey development and measurement techniques. Moreover, it takes quite a\\nbit of research to establish the reliability and validity of a job satisfaction measure. Many organizations don’t\\nhave the employees with the skills needed to construct such measures. Second, it is difficult to know what a\\n227', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 226}),\n",

For example, if employees\\nindicate relatively low levels of satisfaction with salary on some scale, does this mean that they are actually\\ndissatisfied with the money they make? They may merely be stating a desire for more money—a desire shared\\nby most employees of most organizations.\\nStandardized Job Satisfaction Surveys\\nBecause of these problems in creating and interpreting in-house job satisfaction measures, many companies are\\nusing standardized surveys. Recall that “standardized” instruments means that the measures have established\\nreliability and validity and have been widely used. Besides being cost effective, a major advantage of using\\nsuch standardized measures is that they provide normative data that permit the comparison of ratings with\\nthose from similar groups of workers in other companies who have completed the survey. This allows the\\norganization to know whether the job satisfaction levels of its employees are low, high, or in the “normal”\\nrange, as compared to other workers in other organizations. As demonstrated earlier in the comparison of\\nlevels of satisfaction with salary, if a company simply assumes its employees’ ratings are low (when, in fact,\\nthey are average when compared to the norm), management may spend time and resources on a problem that\\ndoesn’t exist.\\nThe ability to compare scores from standardized job satisfaction measures that have been obtained from\\ndifferent groups of workers in different companies also allows researchers to investigate the various\\norganizational factors that cause job satisfaction and dissatisfaction. In other words, if different questionnaires\\nwere used for all studies, researchers could not be sure that the studies were measuring and comparing the\\nsame things.\\n228', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 227}),\n",

Within each of the five facets is a list of\\nwords or short phrases. Respondents indicate whether the word or phrase describes their job, using the\\nanswers “yes,” “no,” and “undecided.” Each of the words or phrases has a numerical value that reflects how\\nwell it describes a typically satisfying job. Items checked within each scale are summed, yielding five\\nsatisfaction scores that reflect the five facets of job satisfaction. In the past it was suggested that the five scales\\ncould be summed into a total score of overall job satisfaction. However, one study indicates that such a total\\nscore is not the best overall measure and suggests the use of a global assessment instrument called the Job In\\nGeneral (or JIG scale) as an accompaniment to the five JDI scales (Ironson et al., 1989).\\nJob Descriptive Index (JDI)\\n a self-report job satisfaction rating scale measuring five job facets\\nSince its development in the 1960s, the JDI has become the most widely used standardized measure of job\\nsatisfaction (Roznowski, 1989). Moreover, the JDI has been revised and improved several times over the years\\n(e.g., Gillespie et al., 2016; Smith, Kendall, & Hulin, 1987). \\nFigure 9.2\\n presents sample items from the JDI.\\nBoth the MSQ and the JDI have been widely researched, and both have established relatively high levels of\\nreliability and validity (Kinicki, McKee-Ryan, Schriesheim, & Carson, 2002; Smith et al., 1969, 1987; Weiss et al.,\\n1967). One obvious difference between the two measures is the number of job satisfaction facets measured: the\\nJDI measures 5 facets; the MSQ assesses 20. An important question is how many or how few facets are needed\\nto measure job satisfaction adequately. One study suggested that some of the JDI facets could be split into two\\nparts. For example, the satisfaction with supervision scale could be split into satisfaction with the supervisor’s\\nability and satisfaction with the supervisor’s interpersonal skills (Yeager, 1981). Other evidence indicates that\\nsome of the 20 MSQ scales are highly correlated with one another and thus could be collapsed into fewer facets\\n(Gillet & Schwab, 1975; Wong, Hui, & Law, 1998). One may conclude from these viewpoints that there is no\\nconsensus on what constitutes the ideal or best measurement of job satisfaction. However, most researchers do\\nagree that a valid, reliable, and standardized instrument will provide the most accurate assessment.\\nIn addition to the MSQ and JDI, a number of job satisfaction scales have been developed for research\\npurposes, such as the \\nJob Satisfaction Survey\\n (Spector, 1997a), a briefer facet measure of job satisfaction that\\nhas been used sporadically in research. From the practitioner standpoint, numerous consulting firms specialize\\nin job satisfaction/employee satisfaction surveys, although companies need to use caution because many of\\nthese surveys have not, like the MSQ and JDI, been subjected to rigorous research evaluation.\\n230', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 229}),\n",

Are such personal relationships at work as important to workers throughout the world as they appear\\nto be with American workers? And what other aspects of work add to job satisfaction for workers outside\\nthe U.S.?\\nOne study conducted in Japan found that supportive supervision, as well as support from coworkers,\\nwas positively correlated with workers’ job satisfaction (Kumara & Koichi, 1989).

Similarly, workers in Australia\\n(Hopkins, 1990), Canada (Baba & Jamal, 1991), and the Netherlands (Efraty & Sirgy, 1990) appear to be\\nmore satisfied with jobs that offer diverse tasks and independence. These facets of the job may also\\naccount for the findings in the U.S. and in other developed nations that show that older workers and\\nthose holding higher-level jobs experience more satisfaction than very young workers and those in blue-\\ncollar positions (Gamst & Otten, 1992; Gattiker & Howg, 1990; Kravitz, Linn, & Shapiro, 1990). In fact, one\\ncomparison of white-collar workers in the U.S. and India found remarkable similarity in the factors that\\ncontributed to these workers’ job satisfaction (Takalkar & Coovert, 1994).\\nObviously, the international findings discussed here are mostly based on studies of workers in\\ndeveloped countries, where workers enjoy a certain level of job security, adequate pay, and good working\\nconditions. For example, one study found differences in job satisfaction levels between U.S. workers and\\nworkers in the Philippines (Rothausen, Gonzalez, & Griffin, 2009). Another study found differences in job\\nsatisfaction among workers from countries in central and eastern Europe (Lange, 2009). Whether or not\\nworkers in more underdeveloped nations would look to such things as task variety and autonomy for\\nsources of job satisfaction has not yet been determined (Judge, Parker, Colbert, Heller, & Ilies, 2001).\\nPerhaps workers in underdeveloped nations have different sources of satisfaction, which are possibly\\nrelated to more basic survival needs (e.g., pay) than workers in more developed nations. However, one\\nwould expect that as these nations develop and gain economic strength, workers the world over will look\\nto their jobs to fulfill higher-level needs, such as support from coworkers, recognition, and the\\nopportunity to control their own work behaviors and reach their highest potential.\\nIt is important to mention that cultural factors can affect both how workers define and perceive job\\nsatisfaction and how members of different countries or cultural groups respond to job satisfaction measures.

Moreover, the job design theories of motivation discussed in \\nChapter 8\\n—\\nHerzberg’s two-factor theory and the job characteristics model—are as much theories of job satisfaction as they\\nare of motivation. Both theories emphasize that satisfaction with the job is a key to determining motivation. Is\\nthere any truth to this notion that the “happy worker is the productive worker”?\\nA meta-analysis suggests that there is indeed a moderate correlation between job satisfaction and job\\nperformance (Judge, Thoresen, Bono, & Patton, 2001). But what is the causal relationship? Does job satisfaction\\ncause job performance? One early theory of the job satisfaction–performance relationship suggests that it may\\nbe the other way around: good job performance leads to (causes) job satisfaction! (But, of course, it is not that\\nsimple, as other factors mediate the relationship.)\\nThis early theory, suggested by Porter and Lawler (1968), clarifies how this process might operate.

Instead, effective job performance leads to\\njob-related rewards, such as pay increases, promotions, or a sense of accomplishment. If the process for\\noffering these rewards is perceived as fair, receiving these rewards leads to job satisfaction and to higher and\\nhigher levels of performance. This creates a situation in which job satisfaction and job performance are\\nactually independent of one another, but are linked because both are affected by job-related rewards (see\\nFigure 9.3\\n). Interestingly, the \\nPorter–Lawler model\\n builds on the equity theory of motivation discussed in\\nChapter 8\\n, because notions of equity—fairness in job-related inputs and outcomes—are central to the argument.\\nSpecifically, motivation to perform the job and the satisfaction derived from the job are both caused by the\\nrelationship between what an individual puts into the job and what is received from the job in terms of\\nrewards. In other words, both motivation and job satisfaction come from the perceived equitable relationship\\nbetween the employee’s inputs to the job and the job outcomes.\\nPorter–Lawler Model\\n a theory where the relationship between job satisfaction and performance is\\nmediated by work-related rewards\\nMany other factors could potentially affect the job satisfaction–performance relationship, for example, the\\ntypes of jobs that people perform. In fact, evidence suggests that job satisfaction might be more strongly related\\nto job performance for individuals in complex jobs, such as managers, scientists, and engineers, than in more\\nstructured jobs such as accounting and sales (Judge et al., 2001). Complex jobs, because they require creativity\\nand ingenuity, might offer more opportunity for intrinsic reinforcement, and that may strengthen the\\nconnection between satisfaction and performance, in comparison to more routine jobs, where satisfaction may\\nbe more affected by the structure or conditions of work, or extrinsic rewards.\\nFigure 9.3\\n The Porter–Lawler Model of the job performance–job satisfaction relationship.\\nSource:\\n Porter, L.

A sense of being fairly treated is a very important\\ndeterminant of job satisfaction (Clay-Warner, Reynolds, & Roman, 2005).\\nIn summary, both job satisfaction and job performance are important but complex work outcomes. There is\\nsome evidence that these two variables are linked, but the relationship is not necessarily direct and is likely\\ninfluenced by a variety of other variables, such as job-related rewards, job complexity, feelings of equity and\\njustice, and other factors.\\nOrganizational Commitment\\nJust as there are different operational definitions of job satisfaction, so, too, are there different definitions of the\\nconstruct of organizational commitment. For example, is it an attitude, a behavior, or both? Previously,\\norganizational commitment, also referred to as company loyalty, was associated with an acceptance of the\\norganization’s goals and values, a willingness to exert effort on behalf of the organization, and a desire to\\nremain with the organization (Porter, Steers, Mowday, & Boulian, 1974). This definition encompasses both\\nattitudes and behaviors. More recently, the concept of organizational commitment has been taken to imply\\nworker attitudes, such as those just mentioned, whereas the concept of organizational citizenship behaviors\\n(OCB) refers to commitment-related behaviors (Organ, 1990). (We will discuss OCB more fully later in this\\nchapter.) For example, there is a negative correlation between the attitude of organizational commitment and\\nthe behavior of quitting a job. Organizational commitment is similar to job satisfaction because both involve\\nfeelings about the work situation (and both can be seen as components of the “umbrella” construct of employee\\nengagement). However, because organizational commitment deals specifically with workers’ attitudes about\\nthe organization, it may be more directly linked to employee attendance variables such as absenteeism and\\nturnover than is job satisfaction. A good definition of \\norganizational commitment\\n is that it is the worker’s\\nattitudes about the entire work organization.\\nOrganizational Commitment\\n a worker’s feelings and attitudes about the entire work organization\\nThe most widely used organizational commitment measure is a 15-item self-report instrument called the\\nOrganizational Commitment Questionnaire (OCQ), which is presented in \\nFigure 9.4\\n. Another model of\\norganizational commitment views it as composed of three dimensions: \\naffective commitment\\n, which is the\\nemployee’s emotional attachment to the organization; \\ncontinuance commitment\\n, which refers to commitment\\nto continue with the organization because there are costs associated with leaving; and \\nnormative commitment\\n,\\nwhich is like a sense of duty or obligation to stay with the company (Meyer & Allen, 1997). Separate scales are\\nused to measure each of these three commitment dimensions (Meyer, Allen, & Smith, 1993).

Workers thus avoid cognitive dissonance by convincing\\nthemselves that they are satisfied simply because they are loyal to the organization (“I have stayed with this\\ncompany through thick and thin, therefore I must like my job.”). Although it is conceivable that a worker could\\nbe quite satisfied with a job but have low feelings of commitment to the organization, or vice versa, the\\nfeelings tend to be positively related. Studies show mixed results as to the direction of influence between these\\ntwo constructs. For example, O’Driscoll et al. (1992) found that job satisfaction may directly affect\\norganizational commitment, whereas other studies indicate that organizational commitment leads to job\\nsatisfaction (Becker & Billings, 1993; Vandenberg & Lance, 1992).\\nBoth organizational commitment and job satisfaction are most likely affected by numerous factors, including\\nthe type and variety of work, the autonomy involved in the job, the level of responsibility associated with the\\njob, the quality of the social relationships at work, compensation, and the chances for promotion and\\nadvancement in the company. However, there appears to be some consensus that organizational values\\ninfluence organizational commitment, whereas perceived equity of rewards influences job satisfaction. That is,\\nperceived fairness in rewards influences job satisfaction, whereas perceived congruence between\\norganizational and employee values, and between organizational values and actions, tends to influence\\norganizational commitment (Finegan, 2000; Fritz, Arnett, & Conkel, 1999). If employees feel that the\\norganization cares about them and supports them, organizational commitment tends to be higher (Kim,\\nEisenberger, & Baik, 2016). Organizational commitment also tends to be weakened by the perceived chances of\\nfinding a job with another company (Bateman & Strasser, 1984; Gilbert & Ivancevich, 2000). For instance, if\\nhighly skilled worker Carol could easily find a job with another company, but her friend Kim had difficulty\\nfinding her current job, Carol will likely have a lower level of organizational commitment than Kim. In\\naddition, there appears to be positive correlations between organizational commitment and age, education, and\\ntime on the job, such that older and more educated workers and those with longer tenure with the company,\\ntend to be more committed to the organization (Becker & Billings, 1993; Lee, Ashford, Walsh, & Mowday,\\n1992).\\nAs discussed in \\nChapter 1\\n, beginning in the 1990s and into the financial “melt-downs” of the past decade,\\nmany organizations found it necessary to reduce the size of their workforces by laying off or terminating\\nworkers. Thousands of people at a time can lose their jobs when a major corporation reduces the number of\\npeople it employs. Such actions, called \\ndownsizing\\n (although some companies have tried to soften this term by\\nrelabeling it “rightsizing”), can have an impact on the workers who are retained, as well as on those who lose\\ntheir jobs. For many of the remaining employees, feelings of organizational commitment and job satisfaction\\ncan decline following downsizing, especially if the employees are close to those who were laid off or if they\\nfeel that their own jobs may be in jeopardy. However, studies show that explanations from management giving\\nthe reasons for the layoffs and giving remaining employees a sense of control over their future work situations\\ncan have positive effects on the remaining workforce (Brockner et al., 2004). If employees feel that they have\\nbeen treated fairly during the downsizing, there is less negative impact on organizational commitment (van\\nDierendonck & Jacobs, 2012). There is also some evidence that the overall work effort of employees may\\nactually increase following downsizing (Taylor & Giannantonio, 1993).\\nAs you might imagine, maintaining job satisfaction and organizational commitment is a challenge to both\\nemployers and employees—a challenge that becomes even more difficult during trying economic times. Yet\\norganizations must be concerned with both employee job satisfaction and organizational commitment if they\\nare to maintain a high-quality, loyal workforce.\\nEmployee Attitudes and Employee Attendance\\nAs previously mentioned, employee attendance variables such as absenteeism and turnover are associated with\\nemployee engagement, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment. Employees who are engaged, or who\\nhave positive feelings about their jobs and work organizations, should be less likely to be absent from work and\\nto leave for a job elsewhere than those who are disengaged and hold negative attitudes about their jobs.\\nHowever, before considering these relationships, we must consider how employee attendance variables are\\ndefined and measured (Hackett & Guion, 1985; Johns, 1994b; Lee, 1989).\\n236', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 235}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Employee Absenteeism\\nBoth absenteeism and turnover can be categorized into voluntary and involuntary forms. Voluntary\\nabsenteeism is when employees miss work because they want to do something else. Calling in sick to take a\\nthree-day weekend or taking a day off to run errands or to go shopping are examples of voluntary absenteeism.\\nInvoluntary absenteeism occurs when the employee has a legitimate excuse for missing work, typically illness.\\nBecause involuntary absenteeism is inevitable, the organization must be prepared to accept a certain amount of\\nsuch absences. It is voluntary absenteeism, however, that the organization would like to eliminate. Of course, it\\nis very difficult to distinguish voluntary from involuntary absenteeism because most employees are unlikely to\\nadmit that they were voluntarily absent (Dalton & Mesch, 1991; Hammer & Landau, 1981). One way that\\nresearchers have operationalized the measurement of voluntary and involuntary absenteeism is to use absence\\nfrequency (the number of days absent) as a measure of voluntary absenteeism and absence length (the number\\nof consecutive days absent) as an assessment of involuntary absenteeism (Atkin & Goodman, 1984). However,\\nthis is a very crude measure. It is important to note that voluntary absenteeism is likely to be more strongly\\nassociated with employee job satisfaction; involuntary absenteeism is beyond the control of the employee\\n(Sagie, 1998).\\nResearch examining the relationship between job satisfaction and employee absenteeism has produced\\nconflicting findings. Sometimes, there is a slight negative relationship between the two (with higher levels of\\njob satisfaction associated with lower rates of absenteeism; Ostroff, 1993a), and sometimes no significant\\nrelationship \\nat all is found (Ilgen & Hollenback, 1977; Porter & Steers, 1973). A meta-analysis of a number of\\nstudies indicates that job satisfaction and absenteeism are indeed negatively correlated but that the relationship\\nbetween the two is not very strong (Scott & Taylor, 1985). One reason the relationship is not as strong as one\\nmight think stems from problems in measuring absenteeism that cause voluntary and involuntary absenteeism\\nto be lumped together in most of these studies. In other words, there may be a significant negative correlation\\nbetween job satisfaction and voluntary absenteeism, but no significant relationship between job satisfaction\\nand involuntary absenteeism due to illness. According to one study, there is an association between voluntary\\nabsence and job satisfaction; however, this study concluded that rather than job satisfaction causing the\\nabsenteeism, it was really the absenteeism that was leading to lower job satisfaction (Tharenou, 1993). Perhaps\\nto avoid cognitive dissonance, workers who voluntarily missed work rationalized that if they were choosing to\\nbe absent, they must not have been very satisfied with their jobs.\\nAnother problem might be that even though workers are satisfied with their jobs, they may find certain\\nnonwork activities (for example, taking an extra day of vacation or attending a sporting event) more\\ninteresting or more important (Youngblood, 1984). Employees may also be absent because of factors beyond\\ntheir control, such as health, transportation, or childcare problems (Goldberg & Waldman, 2000). Additionally,\\nindividual absenteeism may be affected by coworkers’ absenteeism rates and by the organization’s policy and\\n“climate” toward absenteeism (Gellatly, 1995; Johns, 1994a; Markham & McKee, 1995). For example, if\\ncoworkers are frequently absent, or if management has a lenient policy that is tolerant of absences, employees\\nmight be inclined to miss work regardless of how satisfied or dissatisfied they are with their jobs (Haccoun &\\nJeanrie, 1995; Harrison & Martocchio, 1998).\\nFinally, although the construct of absenteeism may appear quite simple, it, like other behaviors, is probably\\nmore complicated than it appears to be on the surface. Some of this complexity may be illustrated by studies\\nindicating a negative correlation between age and voluntary absenteeism and a positive correlation between\\nage and involuntary absenteeism (Hackett, 1990). In other words, younger workers tend to voluntarily miss\\nwork, whereas older workers tend to miss work because they are more frequently ill.\\nIt seems apparent that absenteeism, especially voluntary absenteeism, would be related to turnover (e.g.,\\nworkers who have a lot of unexcused absences don’t last long on the job). A meta-analysis found a small\\npositive relationship (r = 0.25) between absenteeism and turnover and a pattern of employee “withdrawal,” as\\nworkers who tended to be late arriving at work had greater rates of absenteeism, which, in turn, led to higher\\nrates of turnover (Berry, Lelchook, & Clark, 2012).\\nEmployee Turnover\\n237', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 236}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='As with absenteeism, there are difficulties in defining and measuring turnover (Cam-pion, 1991). Involuntary\\nturnover occurs when an employee is fired or laid off. A certain amount of involuntary turnover is likely to be\\nconsidered inevitable and \\npossibly even beneficial. Firing workers who are not performing at desirable levels\\ncan be viewed as a positive, “weeding” process (Manz, Fugate, Hom, & Millikin, 2015; Mobley, 1982). Layoffs\\noften occur for financial reasons and thus are likely to be beyond the control of management. Most voluntary\\nturnover takes place when a competent and capable employee leaves to work elsewhere. It is this turnover that\\nis costly to the organization because losing a valued employee means reduced organizational productivity and\\nincreased expenses associated with hiring and training a replacement. According to one school of thought,\\nvoluntary turnover is likely to be influenced by lack of job satisfaction and organizational commitment,\\nwhereas involuntary turnover is not. As is the case with absenteeism, research that does not distinguish\\nbetween voluntary and involuntary turnover may not find the expected relationships between employee\\nattitudes and turnover simply because the two types of turnover are lumped together. Interestingly, some\\nresearchers note that there are also problems in categorizing turnover as either voluntary or involuntary\\nbecause some poor workers may not be fired but may voluntarily choose to leave the organization, which is\\nlikely to be glad to see them go. However, this means that voluntary turnover might be further classified as\\neither dysfunctional or functional, depending on whether it has negative or beneficial outcomes for the\\norganization (Dalton, Krackhardt, & Porter, 1981). More recently, it has been suggested that involuntary\\nturnover caused by downsizing—so-called reduction-in-force turnover—should be treated as a completely\\ndifferent category than either voluntary or involuntary turnover (McElroy, Morrow, & Rude, 2001).\\nBoth job satisfaction and organizational commitment have been investigated as predictors of employee\\nturnover. Meta-analyses indicate that both low levels of job satisfaction and organizational commitment are\\nrelated to higher rates of turnover (Griffeth, Hom, & Gaertner, 2000). Research has demonstrated that\\norganizational commitment develops from job satisfaction and in turn influences an employee’s decision to\\nremain with or leave the organization (Gaertner, 2000; Williams & Hazer, 1986). However, although\\norganizational commitment appears to be a predictor of turnover, one of the best predictors of employee\\nturnover is absenteeism, particularly the rate of absences in the years immediately before the employee leaves\\n(Griffeth et al., 2000; Mitra, Jenkins, & Gupta, 1992).\\nThere is also some evidence that voluntary turnover can occur in clusters of employees—what can be\\nreferred to as \\ncollective turnover\\n (Heavey, Holwerda, & Hausknecht, 2013). This makes sense because\\nemployees develop social networks, and negative attitudes toward the organization may develop and be\\nreinforced by other employees in the network. Whereas a network of strongly committed employees can\\nreduce turnover, growing dissatisfaction within the group may lead to employees leaving in clusters (Ballinger,\\nCross, & Holtom, 2016).\\nTurnover Intentions\\n workers’ self-reported intentions to leave their jobs\\nResearchers have turned their attention to measuring employees’ self-reported intentions to leave, or\\nturnover intentions, in an effort to prevent the loss of valuable employees. We have already seen that employee\\nengagement leads to reduced \\nturnover intentions.\\n The obvious problem with measuring turnover intentions is\\nthat many workers who report that they intend to quit their jobs may not actually turn over because they lack\\nalternative employment, because they reevaluate the \\nsituation, or because they are not risk takers (Allen,\\nWeeks, & Moffitt, 2005; Vandenberg & Barnes-Nelson, 1999). Regardless of the strength of the connection\\nbetween intentions to turn over and actual turnover, measuring employees’ intentions to quit their jobs can be\\na measure of dissatisfaction with the job or organization and used by employers to try to remedy the situation\\nto prevent costly turnover.\\nBecause voluntary turnover can be costly to an organization, it is important to understand some of the\\nreasons why good performers may leave their jobs (Lee & Maurer, 1997). It has been found that productive,\\nvaluable employees who do not receive work-related rewards, such as promotions and pay raises, are likely\\ncandidates for leaving their jobs (Trevor, Gerhart, & Boudreau, 1997). Simply stated, employees who feel that\\nthey are not treated fairly are more prone to leave (Griffeth & Gaertner, 2001; Poon, 2012).

As stated earlier, both job satisfaction and organizational commitment are\\nassociated with turnover, and this need for workers to feel that they have some influence within the\\norganization may help explain this association. That is, those workers who have such influence are probably\\nmore satisfied with their jobs and thus more committed to the organization (Dwyer & Ganster, 1991). This may\\nalso help explain the reason that giving workers a sense of power over their jobs or allowing them to\\nparticipate in decision-making processes is associated with higher levels of job satisfaction, as we shall see later\\nin this chapter.\\nIn summary, when examining the relationships between job satisfaction and other outcome variables such as\\nabsenteeism and turnover, it is important to consider the type of absenteeism and turnover being measured.\\nVoluntary absenteeism and turnover are most likely to be affected by employee attitudes. Unfortunately, many\\nstudies do not distinguish between voluntary and involuntary absenteeism and turnover, which leads to a\\npossible “watering down” of any observed effects. Moreover, cause-and-effect relationships often cannot be\\nassumed. In fact, some studies indicate that the relationships are reciprocal, with each variable sometimes\\nbeing the “cause” and at other times being the “effect.”\\nIncreasing Employee Engagement, Job Satisfaction, and Organizational\\nCommitment\\nAs we have seen, employee engagement, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment are considered\\nimportant by organizations because they are linked to costly absenteeism and turnover. Job satisfaction is\\nparticularly important to the employee because it reflects a critical work outcome: feelings of fulfillment from\\nthe job and the work setting. Because of this, organizations have implemented a number of programs and\\ntechniques in an effort to increase employees’ engagement, satisfaction, and commitment. These programs take\\nmany forms. Some \\nchange the structure of work, others alter the methods of worker compensation, and still\\nothers offer innovative fringe benefit plans and packages. We will examine some of these techniques.\\nChanges in Job Structure\\nThree techniques have been used to try to increase employee satisfaction and engagement by changing the\\nstructure of jobs. The first technique, \\njob rotation,\\n which was introduced in \\nChapter 7\\n, involves moving\\nworkers from one specialized job to another. Although job rotation can be used to train workers in a variety of\\ntasks, it can also be used to alleviate the monotony and boredom associated with performing the same work,\\nday in and day out. For example, an employee in a retail store may move from maintenance and cleanup duties\\nto stocking merchandise to bagging merchandise on a weekly basis. A receptionist in a large organization\\nmight rotate from greeting visitors and answering telephones to simple clerical duties such as filing and\\nphotocopying. Research shows that job rotation can be related to job satisfaction, as well as contributing to\\nincreases in salary and opportunities for promotion (Campion et al., 1994; Jeon & Jeong, 2016).\\nJob Rotation\\n the systematic movement of workers from one type of task to another to alleviate boredom\\nand monotony (as well as training workers on different tasks; see \\nChapter 7\\n)\\nJob enlargement\\n is the practice of allowing workers to take on additional, varied tasks in an effort to make\\nthem feel that they are more valuable members of the organization. For example, a custodian who is\\nresponsible for the cleaning and upkeep of several rooms might progressively have the job enlarged until the\\njob’s duties involve the maintenance of an entire floor. Job enlargement is tricky to implement because it\\n239', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 238}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='means that workers are required to do additional work, which some might perceive as negative. However, if\\nused correctly, job enlargement can positively affect job satisfaction by giving an employee a greater sense of\\naccomplishment and improving valuable work skills. One study of enlarged jobs found that they led to greater\\nemployee satisfaction, improved employee initiative, and better customer service than persons in nonenlarged\\njobs. However, enlarged jobs carried the “costs” of requiring more skilled, more highly trained, and more costly\\n(higher paid) workers than those performing nonenlarged jobs (Campion & McClelland, 1991).\\nJob Enlargement\\n the expansion of a job to include additional, more varied work tasks\\nJob enrichment\\n, which we studied in depth in \\nChapter 8\\n, can also be used to increase employee engagement\\nand job satisfaction. Recall that job enrichment involves raising the level of responsibility associated with a\\nparticular job by allowing workers a greater voice in the planning, execution, and evaluation of their own\\nactivities. For example, in one such program, assembly-line workers were divided into teams, each of which\\nwas given many of the responsibilities that were previously held by frontline supervisors, including ordering\\nsupplies, setting output rates, creating quality control inspection systems, and even appraising their own\\nperformance. This independence and increased responsibility can go a long way toward increasing motivation\\nand job satisfaction for many workers, and enriched jobs may be more important today to younger workers\\n(Beltran-Martin & Roca-Puig, 2013). Although job enrichment and job enlargement seem somewhat similar\\nbecause both require more work from employees, job enrichment raises the level of tasks, whereas job\\nenlargement does not raise the level of responsibility associated with the work.\\nChanges in Pay Structure\\nAccording to research, the perception of fairness in pay is associated with greater job satisfaction (Witt & Nye,\\n1992). And although the relationship between pay and job satisfaction is not always a direct, positive one, there\\nis some evidence that employees who are compensated well are less likely to search for jobs elsewhere (Cotton\\n& Tuttle, 1986; Trevor et al., 1997). Although most innovative compensation programs are introduced primarily\\nin an effort to improve job performance, many changes also increase levels of job satisfaction.\\nOne innovative compensation program is \\nskill-based pay\\n (also known as \\nknowledge-based pay\\n), which\\ninvolves paying employees an hourly rate based on their knowledge and skills rather than on the particular job\\nto which they are assigned (Lawler, Mohrman, & Ledford, 1992). In other words, workers are paid for the level\\nof the job that they are able to perform rather than paid for the title or particular position that they hold. For\\nexample, two individuals may both have the job title of auditor, but one, who is more skilled, receives higher\\npay because she had advanced auditing skills and the other doesn’t.\\nSkill-Based Pay\\n a system of compensation in which workers are paid based on their knowledge and skills\\nrather than on their positions in the organization\\nFor skill-based pay programs to be cost effective, it is imperative that employees be assigned to jobs that\\nmatch the levels of their skills and knowledge. Research indicates that workers are more satisfied in\\norganizations that use this system than in those that use conventional pay plans, and there is also evidence that\\nthey are more productive, more concerned with quality, less prone to turnover, and more likely to be\\nmotivated to grow and develop on the job (Dierdorff & Surface, 2008; Guthrie, 2000; Mitra, Gupta, & Shaw,\\n2011; Murray & Gerhart, 1998). There is also some evidence that skill-based pay works better in manufacturing\\nas opposed to service organizations (Shaw, Gupta, Mitra, & Ledford, 2005). Particularly satisfied are those who\\nreceive skill-based pay and who also have high levels of ability and motivation (Tosi & Tosi, 1987). One\\nexplanation for the effectiveness of skill-based pay systems is that employees may perceive these compensation\\n240', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 239}),\n",

With\\nthe current emphasis on the “knowledge worker,” and with a dwindling supply of workers possessing the\\nhighest levels of technical knowledge and skills, skill-based pay systems may increase in the future.\\nMerit Pay\\n a compensation system in which employees receive a base rate and additional pay based on\\nperformance\\nThe Porter–Lawler model (see \\nFigure 9.3\\n) suggested that job performance leads to job satisfaction by way of\\nincreased rewards, one of the most important of which is pay. If this is the case, then a system of compensation\\nbased directly on performance should be an effective strategy for increasing job satisfaction. One such pay-for-\\nperformance system is \\nmerit pay,\\n a plan in which the amount of compensation is directly a function of an\\nemployee’s performance. In merit pay plans, workers \\nreceive a financial bonus based on their individual\\noutput. Although sensible in theory, such systems do not work well in practice for a number of reasons\\n(Campbell, Campbell, & Chia, 1998). First, and perhaps most important, difficulties in the objective assessment\\nof performance mean that it is often impossible to distinguish the truly good performers from the more average\\nperformers. This leads to feelings of unfairness in the distribution of merit pay and subsequent employee\\ndissatisfaction (Salimaki & Jamsen, 2010; St-Onge, 2000). Second, most merit pay systems emphasize individual\\ngoals, which may hurt the organization’s overall performance and disrupt group harmony, especially if jobs\\nrequire groups to collaborate for the production of a product. Finally, in many such plans the amount of merit\\ncompensation is quite small in proportion to base salaries. In other words, the merit pay is simply not viewed\\nas a strong incentive to work harder (Balkin & Gomez-Mejia, 1987; Pearce, Stevenson, & Perry, 1985). Research\\nhas suggested that a merit pay raise needs to be at least 7% to have a significant impact on employee attitudes\\nand motivation (Mitra, Gupta, & Jenkins, 1997). Although they are extremely popular, merit pay systems can\\nonly be effective when great care is taken in how these programs are created (Campbell et al., 1998).\\nFigure 9.5\\n \\nAs part of a gainsharing system, this team of auto mechanics competes with other teams for monthly bonuses.\\nSource:\\n wavebreakmedia/\\nShutterstock.com\\nGainsharing\\n a compensation system based on effective group performance\\nAnother strategy for the implementation of pay-for-performance systems is to make pay contingent on\\neffective group performance, a technique termed \\ngainsharing\\n (Lawler, 1987). The notion of group- or team-\\nbased rewards was introduced in \\nChapter 8\\n. In gainsharing, if a work group or department reaches a certain\\nperformance goal, all members of the unit receive a bonus (\\nFigure 9.5\\n). Because the \\nlevel of productivity among\\nworkers usually varies, the gainsharing program must be viewed as being fair to all involved (Welbourne, 1998;\\n241', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 240}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Welbourne & Ferrante, 2008). For example, in one program, workers decided that the fairest plan was to set a\\nminimum amount that could be received by any worker and then base additional pay on each worker’s level of\\nproductivity. Thus, the low producers received some base compensation, but they found that greater pay would\\nresult only if they increased production. The high producers, on the other hand, were well rewarded for their\\nefforts (Cooper, Dyck, & Frohlich, 1992). One longitudinal study of gainsharing found that it was related to\\nmore positive employee attitudes and greater commitment than employees not participating in gainsharing\\n(Hanlon, Meyer, & Taylor, 1994). Another study found that gainsharing improved members’ teamwork as well\\nas their satisfaction with pay (O’Bannon & Pearce, 1999). Rather than focusing on productivity increases, some\\ngainsharing programs reward workers who cut production costs through suggestions and innovations and then\\npass a portion of the savings on to the workers (Arthur & Huntley, 2005). Gainsharing may not be appropriate\\nfor all organizations or for all groups of workers. Therefore, implementation of a gainsharing program must be\\nbased on careful planning and a thorough knowledge of the groups of workers involved (Gomez-Mejia,\\nWelbourne, & Wiseman, 2000; Graham-Moore & Ross, 1990). One important consideration is that a failed\\nattempt at a major change in pay structure, such as a gainsharing plan, could lead to massive worker\\ndissatisfaction (Collins, 1995).\\nStop \\n&\\n Review\\nDescribe three techniques for changing job structure.\\nA more common plan is \\nprofit sharing,\\n in which all employees receive a small share of the organization’s\\nprofits (Rosen, Klein, & Young, 1986). The notion underlying profit sharing is to instill a sense of ownership in\\nemployees, to increase both commitment to the organization and to improve motivation and productivity\\n(Chiu & Tsai, 2007; Cox, 2001; Duncan, 2001). For profit-sharing programs to be effective, it is imperative that\\nemployees buy into the program and understand that profit sharing is linked to performance (Han, Bartol, &\\nKim, 2015; Orlitzky & Rynes, 2001). One drawback is that it is often difficult for employees to see how their\\nindividual performances have an impact on the company’s total output. This may be one reason why profit\\nsharing seems to work better in small companies than in large ones (Bayo-Moriones & Larraza-Kintana, 2009).\\nIn addition, there is typically quite a long delay between reaching performance goals and receiving individual\\nshares of the company’s profits (see the box “Applying I/O Psychology”).\\nProfit Sharing\\n a plan where all employees receive a small share of an organization’s profits\\nEmployee ownership\\n is a program where employees own all or part of an organization. Employee\\nownership can take one of two forms: direct ownership or employee stock ownership. In direct ownership, the\\nemployees are the sole owners of the organization. In employee stock ownership programs, which are the more\\ncommon of the two, stock options are considered part of a benefit package whereby employees acquire shares\\nof company stock over time. Each employee eventually becomes a company stockholder and has voting rights\\nin certain company decisions. Proponents of these programs claim that although they are expensive, the costs\\nare offset by savings created by increased employee organizational commitment, productivity, work quality,\\nand job satisfaction and decreases in rates of absenteeism and turnover (Buchko, 1992; Rosen, Case, & Staubus,\\n2005).\\nEmployee Ownership\\n a program where employees own all or part of an organization\\nOf course, tales of the quick success of employee-owned companies in the 1990s, such as Southwest Airlines,\\n242', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 241}),\n",

Other research indicates that if employee ownership is going to increase\\norganizational commitment, certain criteria must be met, the most obvious being that the program must be\\nfinancially rewarding to employees (French & Rosenstein, 1984). Moreover, higher-level employees may have\\nmore positive reactions to employee ownership programs than do lower-level workers (Wichman, 1994). One\\ninvestigation further qualified the conditions required for the success of employee ownership programs.\\nExamining 37 employee stock ownership companies, the study found that rates of employee organizational\\ncommitment and satisfaction were highest when the companies made substantial financial contributions to the\\nemployee stock purchases, when management was highly committed to the program, and when there was a\\ngreat deal of communication about the program (Klein, 1987). In addition, the Oliver (1990) study found that\\nthe rewards of employee ownership would only have a positive impact on the workers if they place a high\\nvalue on those rewards. For example, if a worker values the work for its own merits, the worker would likely\\nfeel about the same level of satisfaction whether she was working for an employee-owned company or not.\\nFlexible Work Schedules\\nAnother strategy for improving worker satisfaction and commitment is to provide alternative or flexible work\\nschedules. Flexible work schedules give workers greater control over their workday, which can be important in\\nlarge urban areas, where workers are able to commute at nonpeak times, or for workers with childcare\\nresponsibilities.\\nApplying I/O Psychology:\\nUsing Assessment to Enhance Employee Engagement\\nThroughout the years, I have used employee surveys, including standardized job satisfaction and\\norganizational commitment measures and instruments designed for specific organizations, as a means to\\ngauge levels of employee job satisfaction. Often these are the starting point for programs designed to spot\\nprograms, policies, and procedures that are favorable or unfavorable among employees.\\nIn one large banking institution, the employees became very involved in the surveys and in the\\nprograms designed to enhance employee life and well-being that followed the assessments. The surveys\\nlooked specifically at the programs that employees viewed favorably (these were continued and\\nsometimes expanded) and those practices that employees disliked or problems that surfaced from the\\nsurveys. The president of the bank would then ask for volunteers to serve on task forces to address the\\nproblems and to try to make the work-place better. Employees were so engaged in this program that the\\nnumber of volunteers exceeded by four to five times the number of available slots on the task forces. It\\nwas no wonder that, over time, this organization was identified as one of the “great places to work” in\\nannual rankings.\\nOne type of flexible schedule is \\ncompressed workweeks,\\n in which the number of workdays is decreased\\nwhile the number of hours worked per day is increased. Most common are four 10-hour days, and certain\\ngroups, such as nurses, may work three 12-hour shifts per week. Workers may prefer a compressed schedule\\nbecause the extra day off allows workers time to take care of tasks that need to be done Monday through\\nFriday, such as going to the doctor, dentist, or tax accountant. Usually compressed workweeks include a three-\\nday weekend, which allows workers more free time to take weekend vacations. Both of these benefits should\\ncut down on absenteeism, because workers previously might have called in sick to take an extra day of\\n243', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 242}),\n",

However,\\na drawback is that working parents might have difficulty finding childcare for the extended workday. Also on\\nthe negative side, a 10-hour (or 12-hour) work-day is more exhausting than the typical 8-hour day\\n(Cunningham, 1989; Ronen & Primps, 1981; Rosa, Colligan, & Lewis, 1989). This fatigue may lead to decreases\\nin work productivity and concern for work quality (although many people say that the extra couple of hours\\nare not necessarily tiring). Meta-analyses suggest that although employees tend to be satisfied with compressed\\nworkweeks and exhibit higher overall job satisfaction, there is no reduction in absenteeism associated with\\ncompressed schedules (Baltes, Briggs, Huff, Wright, & Neuman, 1999; Di Milia, 1998). In addition, one study\\nfound that workers had more favorable attitudes toward compressed work schedules if they had participated in\\nthe decision to implement the schedule change (Latack & Foster, 1985).\\nCompressed Workweeks\\n schedules that decrease the number of days in the workweek while increasing\\nthe number of hours worked per day\\nFlextime\\n a schedule that commits an employee to working a specified number of hours per week, but\\noffers flexibility in regard to the beginning and ending times for each day\\nFlextime\\n is a scheduling system whereby a worker is committed to a specified number of hours per week\\n(usually 40) but has some flexibility concerning the starting and ending times of any particular workday. Often\\nflextime schedules operate around a certain core of hours during which all workers must be on the job (such as\\n10 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.). However, the workers can decide when to begin and end \\nthe workday as long as they are\\npresent during the core period and work an 8-hour day. Some flextime schedules even allow workers to borrow\\nand carry hours from one workday to the next or, in some extremely flexible programs, from one week to\\nanother. The only stipulation is that an average of 40 hours per week is maintained. Obviously, only certain\\ntypes of jobs can accommodate flextime.\\nWhat are the primary advantages of flextime? For the worker, it affords a sense of freedom and control over\\nplanning the working day (Hicks & Klimoski, 1981; Ralston, 1989). Workers can sleep in and begin work later\\nin the morning, as long as they make up the time by staying late. Employees who want to leave work early to\\ndo some late-afternoon shopping can arrive early to work that day. One study of commuting workers showed\\nthat flextime commuters reported less driver stress than workers not on flextime (Lucas & Heady, 2002). A\\nstudy of flextime programs found that flextime reduced stress levels for workers in three countries (Canada,\\nIsrael, Russia; Barney & Elias, 2010). Research indicates that flextime programs increase employee satisfaction\\nand commitment and are sometimes positively related to worker productivity (Baltes et al., 1999). Interestingly,\\nflextime pays off for companies that can implement this type of schedule, achieving reduced rates of\\nabsenteeism and the virtual elimination of tardiness (Baltes et al., 1999; Ronen, 1981).\\nBenefit Programs\\nPerhaps the most common way for employers to try to increase employees’ job satisfaction and organizational\\ncommitment is through various benefit programs. Benefit programs can include flexible working hours, a\\nvariety of health care options, different retirement plans, profit sharing, career development programs, health\\npromotion programs, and employee-sponsored childcare. This last program has the potential of becoming one\\nof the most popular and sought-after benefits and may have the extra advantage of helping to decrease\\nabsenteeism caused by employees’ occasional inability to find adequate childcare (Milkovich & Gomez, 1976).\\nInterestingly, however, studies of the effects of employee-sponsored, on-site childcare programs have found\\nthat although they increase worker job satisfaction, the expected reductions in absenteeism rates have been\\nsmall (Goff, Mount, & Jamison, 1990; Kossek & Nichol, 1992).

Lawler (1971) long ago argued that allowing employees to\\nchoose their own benefits led to increases in job satisfaction and ensured that the benefits suited each\\nemployee’s unique needs. One study demonstrated, however, that it is important that employees receive\\nadequate information and guidance regarding the characteristics of the various benefit programs to help them\\nmake an informed choice of benefits that best suit their needs and to avoid dissatisfaction caused by making\\nincorrect choices (Sturman, Hannon, & Milkovich, 1996). Research suggests that cafeteria-style benefits are\\nperceived as a more fair system than traditional benefit plans (Cole & Flint, 2004).

Benefit costs in some\\nEuropean countries are even higher. As a result, organizations often reduce benefit programs as a cost-saving\\nstrategy during times of economic downturn.

Although most of the techniques intended to increase job satisfaction do indeed appear to\\ndo so, there is less evidence that these programs then lead to changes in other important outcome variables\\nsuch as productivity, work quality, absenteeism, and ultimately turnover. If a company implements a program\\naimed at increasing employee job satisfaction, and if management is perceived by employees to be taking\\npositive steps toward the improvement of the workplace, job satisfaction will likely improve immediately after\\nthe introduction of the program. However, it may be unclear whether the program actually caused the increase\\nor if it is really a sort of Hawthorne effect, in which employees’ positive expectations about management’s\\ngood intentions lead to increases in satisfaction merely because something was done. Regardless of the reason\\nfor measured improvements following the implementation of some satisfaction-enhancing program, the\\nincreases may tend to disappear over time as some of the novelty wears off, which long-term follow-up\\nevaluations would reveal.\\nPositive Employee Behaviors\\nAlthough employers want their employees to be satisfied and committed to the organization, job satisfaction\\nand organizational commitment are attitudes.

In addition, employees who engage in more OCBs are less likely to turn\\nover than those who do not engage in OCBs (Chen, Hui, & Sego, 1998) and are less likely to be voluntarily\\nabsent (Lee, Mitchell, Sablynski, Burton, & Holtom, 2004). Moreover, there is evidence that supervisors notice\\nOCBs, tending to give more positive performance appraisals to employees who engage in citizenship behaviors\\nas opposed to those who simply do their jobs. In addition, managers and leaders have been found to play a\\ncritical role in the incidence of employees’ OCBs if the leaders engage in OCBs themselves (Yaffe & Kark,\\n2011). There is even a study that suggests that employees who regularly engage in OCBs are more safety\\nconscious (Gyekye & Salminen, 2005). An important question, however, is, “Do OCBs affect the bottom line?”\\nDo employees’ organizational citizenship behaviors affect organizational performance? Research suggests that\\nemployees who “go the extra mile” and exhibit OCBs do indeed have work groups and organizations that are\\nmore productive and produce higher-quality work than work groups exhibiting low levels of OCBs (Podsakoff\\n& MacKenzie, 1997a). Organizational citizenship behaviors seem to affect work performance in groups as\\ndiverse as salespersons (Podsakoff & MacKenzie, 1994), manufacturing workers (Allen & Rush, 1998; Bommer,\\nDierdorff, & Rubin, 2007), machine crews in a paper mill (Podsakoff, Ahearne, & MacKenzie, 1997), and\\nrestaurant crews (Koys, 2001; Walz & Niehoff, 1996).\\nPodsakoff and MacKenzie (1997a) suggested a number of reasons why OCBs may be related to\\norganizational effectiveness. They include the following:\\n❚\\n\\u2003\\nWorkers who help new coworkers “learn the ropes” help them to speed up the orientation\\nand socialization process and become more productive employees faster.\\n❚\\n\\u2003\\nEmployees who help each other need less managerial supervision, freeing up the managers’\\ntime for other important duties.\\n❚\\n\\u2003\\nEmployees who have positive attitudes toward one another are more cooperative and avoid\\ndestructive conflicts with other workers.\\n❚\\n\\u2003\\nWorkers freely and voluntarily meet outside work times and regularly touch base with one\\nanother, improving the flow of organizational communication.\\n❚\\n\\u2003\\nOCBs lead to a positive work environment and help in the recruitment and retention of the\\nbest-qualified workers.\\n❚\\n\\u2003\\nWorkers pick up the slack and “cover” for one another during absences or times of heavy\\nindividual workloads.\\n❚\\n\\u2003\\nEmployees are more willing to take on new responsibilities or learn new technology or work\\nsystems.\\nAs can be seen, organizational citizenship behaviors lead to work groups that engage in the best sorts of\\norganizational and personnel processes and may help explain what separates the top-performing work groups\\nand organizations from those who have substandard levels of performance. On the other hand, some workers\\nmight be so involved in work and going above and beyond their job descriptions, engaging in so many OCBs,\\nthat it might interfere with their personal lives, similar to the “workaholic” syndrome we saw in \\nChapter 8\\n(Bolino & Turnley, 2005). Indeed, it is critically important that management recognize employees’ OCBs,\\nrecognizing and rewarding employees for engaging in these positive work behaviors, or else workers will\\nexperience a sort of “citizenship fatigue” (“I do all of this for the organization, but no one cares.”)—leading to a\\nnegative impact on the employee and the organization (Bolino, Hsiung, Harvey, & LePine, 2015).\\nAn interesting question concerns whether workers in various countries engage in the same organizational\\ncitizenship behaviors and at the same levels. Research suggests that although OCBs seem to be more or less\\nuniversal, there are differences in how workers and organizations view these behaviors. For example, workers\\n247', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 246}),\n",

Nevertheless, there is evidence that OCBs are\\npositively correlated with measures of the productivity and service quality of Taiwanese bank employees (Yen\\n& Niehoff, 2004), government and manufacturing employees in China (Liu & Cohen, 2010; Liu, Kwan, Fu, &\\nMao, 2013), Korean travel agents (Yoon & Suh, 2003), and U.S. insurance agents (Bell & Menguc, 2002).\\nAs you can imagine, it is in the organization’s best interest to encourage organizational citizenship\\nbehaviors. Research shows that OCBs are affected by whether or not employees perceive the organization as\\ntreating them fairly (Haworth & Levy, 2001; \\nTepper & Taylor, 2003). In addition, employees who feel that their\\nvalues are aligned with the organization are more likely to engage in more OCBs (Deckop, Mangel, & Cirka,\\n1999).\\nPositive Affect and Employee Well-Being\\nIn the past two decades there has been an explosion of research examining the role of positive emotions, or\\npositive affect,\\n in influencing employee attitudes, such as job satisfaction, and fostering positive employee\\nbehaviors (Ashkanasy, Hartel, & Zerbe, 2000; Brief, 2001; Lam, Spreitzer, & Fritz, 2014). Simply stated, an\\nindividual’s mood, positive or negative, can affect all aspects of work (we will look at negative emotions and\\ntheir effects in \\nChapter 10\\n). Not only is a person’s emotional state important, but also there are clearly\\nindividual differences in dispositions toward positive or negative affect (Judge & Larsen, 2001). This is why, as\\nwe saw in the box “On the Cutting Edge,” some individuals just tend to be more satisfied in jobs than other\\nindividuals.\\nPositive Affect\\n positive emotions that affect mood in the workplace\\nMost researchers agree that positive affect influences work behavior through job satisfaction. That is, job\\nsatisfaction mediates the relationship between state and trait (dispositional) affect and important work\\noutcomes, such as absenteeism, turnover, and performance. For example, one study of a group of hotel\\nmanagers found that the affective dispositions of the managers influenced their job satisfaction, which, in turn,\\naffected their job performance (Hochwater, Perrewé, Ferris, & Brymer, 1999). Emotionally positive managers\\nshowed more job satisfaction and had better job performance than emotionally negative managers who were\\ndissatisfied and tended to be poorer performers. Similarly, dispositional positive affect is related to lower rates\\nof stress (Janssen, Lam, & Huang, 2010) and absenteeism, whereas negative affect is related to both higher\\nabsenteeism and higher turnover (Bouckenooghe, Raja, & Butt, 2013; Pelled & Xin, 1999). There is evidence that\\naffectively positive workers are more prone to engage in OCB and to have a broader view of what their job\\nentails (e.g., being more willing to take on “extra” tasks) than emotionally negative workers (Bachrach & Jex,\\n2000; Podsakoff et al., 2000).\\nSo is a positive disposition or emotional state and resulting job satisfaction the “cure-all”? Not necessarily.\\nThere is some evidence that when workers become dissatisfied with some aspect of the work situation, they\\nbecome motivated to change it. Job dissatisfaction has been linked to both creativity and voicing of concern\\n(Zhou & George, 2001). Importantly, no matter how strong an individual’s positive emotions or disposition, if\\nshe or he is not fairly treated or is undercompensated, job satisfaction and positive work behaviors will decline.\\nIt is important to also mention that satisfaction with one’s job is not enough. Workers may have job\\nsatisfaction, but other aspects of their lives (family relationships, physical health, etc.) may not be as positive.\\nI/O psychology has two important objectives in this regard: to improve the physical and social environment at\\nwork in an effort to enhance worker well-being, satisfaction, and life quality and to improve organizational\\noutcomes, such as increased productivity, work quality, and reduced \\nabsenteeism and turnover by increasing\\nemployee participation in, and commitment to, organizational processes (Adams, King, & King, 1996; Beehr &\\nMcGrath, 1992; Danna & Griffin, 1999).\\n248', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 247}),\n",

The most widely used self-report measures are the \\nMinnesota\\nSatisfaction Questionnaire\\n (\\nMSQ\\n) and the \\nJob Descriptive Index\\n (\\nJDI\\n). Research indicates that there is a slight\\npositive relationship between job satisfaction and job performance, although the link may be moderated by\\nanother variable, such as the receipt of work rewards. Job satisfaction is positively correlated with\\norganizational commitment\\n, or employees’ feelings and attitudes about the entire work organization.\\nBoth job satisfaction and organizational commitment tend to be negatively correlated with voluntary\\nemployee absenteeism. However, the relationships are complex and difficult to decipher, partly due to the\\ndifficulty involved in distinguishing voluntary absenteeism from involuntary absenteeism. Job satisfaction and\\norganizational commitment are also related to voluntary employee turnover.\\nPrograms designed to increase job satisfaction include changes in job structure through techniques such as\\njob rotation\\n, \\njob enlargement\\n, and \\njob enrichment\\n. Other satisfaction-enhancing techniques suggest changing\\nthe pay structure by using methods such as \\nskill-based pay\\n, \\npay-for-performance\\n programs like \\nmerit pay\\n,\\ngainsharing\\n, or \\nprofit sharing\\n, which are sometimes contingent on effective group performance.

This chapter deals primarily with worker stress: the stress that occurs at work and affects work\\nbehavior. So be careful not to confuse what you have heard from the media about life stress and what you read\\nin this chapter. For instance, a common misconception is that all stress is bad. As you will find out, a little bit of\\nstress can be motivating and challenging. Yet it is the negative type of stress that gets most of the attention.\\nAnother misconception is that the strategies used in dealing with stress in everyday life will also work in\\ndealing with worker stress. This is not always the case. For example, some stressors can be alleviated by\\norganizational changes and are therefore under the control of management, whereas others must be addressed\\nby the individual worker. In addition, some of the techniques for dealing with stress in the workplace are not so\\nmuch stress-reduction techniques as they are simply good management and human resource practices. Social\\nscientists have had a great deal of difficulty in precisely defining and measuring stress. Be aware of this. Some\\nof the concepts in this chapter are quite abstract and are initially difficult to understand.\\nThis chapter fits well with \\nChapter 9\\n that focused on worker satisfaction and positive worker behaviors and\\nattitudes. In some ways, satisfaction and stress can be opposite sides of the same coin. Jobs can create a great\\ndeal of satisfaction, contributing to a sense of well-being and “worth.” At the same time, however, jobs can\\nsubject us to uncomfortable (and potentially harmful) stress and can lead to negative attitudes and work\\nbehaviors.\\nThe first few weeks of your job were exciting: you were challenged to learn new things and accomplish\\nimportant objectives. You felt good about the job and about \\nyourself. But now work has become routine, and\\nthere is a great sense of pressure. It is sometimes hard to drag yourself out of bed in the morning. Some of this\\nis due to the increasing workload, but you are also having trouble getting along with a particularly difficult\\ncoworker. Sometimes, the pressure from work makes it hard to concentrate; other times you feel sick and\\nunhappy.\\nAs we saw in \\nChapter 9\\n, most workers feel some sense of purpose and accomplishment about their jobs,\\nwhich can be highly rewarding and self-satisfying. However, work can also be a tremendous burden.\\nDeadlines, work overload, and difficult bosses or coworkers can all place considerable pressure and strain on\\nworkers. Thus, jobs and the work environment commonly produce stress, and workers must learn to deal with\\nthat stress. Moreover, the negative behaviors of people at work, ranging from bad attitudes to acts of sabotage\\nand workplace violence, make the work world a difficult (and sometimes dangerous) place. In this section, we\\nwill define worker stress, see how it affects work behavior, look at how it is measured, examine ways that the\\nindividual worker can attempt to cope with it, and consider strategies that organizations can use to try to\\ndecrease stress. We will also look at negative attitudes and dysfunctional behaviors at work and what\\norganizations and individuals can do to try to limit or eliminate these.\\nDefining Worker Stress\\nThe construct of stress is quite complex. So much so, in fact, that researchers cannot agree on a single\\ndefinition for it (Kahn & Boysiere, 1992). Consequently, there are at least eight different definitions (models)\\n252', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 251}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='for stress (Cooper, Dewe, & O’Driscoll, 2002; Ivancevich & Matteson, 1980).\\nAccording to the early stress researcher Hans Selye (1976), stress is primarily a physiological reaction to\\ncertain threatening environmental events. From Selye’s perspective, worker stress would simply refer to the\\nstress caused by events in the work environment. Psychologist John French and his colleagues (French, Caplan,\\n& Harrison, 1982; French, Rogers, & Cobb, 1974) say that worker stress results from a lack of “fit” between a\\nperson’s skills and abilities and the demands of the job and the workplace. In other words, a worker who is\\ntotally unqualified for a particular job should feel a tremendous amount of stress. For example, imagine a\\nworker with little previous experience with computer systems applying for and being hired as a\\ncommunication specialist, only to find out that the job requires a thorough knowledge of various computer\\nnetworking systems. Richard Lazarus (1991; Lazarus & Folk-man, 1984), in his “transactional” view of worker\\nstress, saw stress as resulting from the worker’s perception that a certain environmental event is a threat or a\\nchallenge, factoring in your perception of how capable you will be at managing the threat. From Richard\\nLazarus’s perspective, you and I might interpret the same event very differently—I might find it stressful, you\\nmight view it as totally harmless (or perhaps even as pleasantly challenging!).\\nTo arrive at a definition of worker stress for our purposes, we need to look at what these three different\\napproaches to stress have in common. All three definitions view \\nworker stress as an interaction between the\\nperson and some environmental event, or \\nstressor.\\n In addition, all the definitions emphasize that there are\\nsome important reactions to the stressful event. These reactions can be either physiological or psychological in\\nnature, or both. Therefore, we will define \\nworker stress\\n as physiological and/or psychological reactions to an\\nevent that is perceived to be threatening or taxing.\\nStressor\\n an environmental event that is perceived by an individual to be threatening\\nWorker Stress\\n the physiological and/or psychological reactions to events that are perceived to be\\nthreatening or taxing\\nAlthough we most often think of stress as an unpleasant state, it can have both negative and positive aspects.\\nFor example, imagine that you have been working for several years as an assistant manager for a large\\ncompany and find out that you have just received a promotion to department manager, a position you have\\nbeen trying to obtain for some time. With your new position come feelings of stress. Some of these are\\nnegative, such as the stress that will result from having to work many overtime hours without additional\\ncompensation, being required to make formal presentations regularly to your peers and superiors (and having\\nyour presentations critically evaluated by them), and taking on the responsibility to take the criticism for any\\nproblems occurring in your department. On the other hand, many positive reactions are associated with the\\npromotion, including feelings of accomplishment, anticipation, pride, and challenge. Like the negative aspects,\\nthese positive responses also induce physiological and psychological reactions in the body. Some stress\\nresearchers distinguish the negative stress, termed \\ndistress\\n, from the positive kind of stress, called \\neustress\\n (see,\\ne.g., Golembiewski, Munzenrider, & Stevenson, 1986; Nelson & Simmons, 2011; Parker & Ragsdale, 2015).\\nWe are all likely familiar with the physiological reactions to stress. They include signs of arousal such as\\nincreased heart and respiratory rates, elevated blood pressure, and profuse sweating. The psychological\\nreactions to distress include feeling anxiety, fear, frustration, and despair, as well as appraising or evaluating\\nthe stressful event and its impact, thinking about the stressful experience, and mentally preparing to take steps\\nto try to deal with the stress.\\nIn many ways, stress is a perceptual process. An event that one individual perceives to be stressful may not\\nbe labeled as such by someone else. For example, making a formal presentation in front of a large audience\\nmay be perceived as extremely stressful for the average college student, but may be perceived as energizing\\n(and perhaps fun) by a person who is accustomed to public speaking. Because stress may cause a variety of\\nreactions and feelings, and because perceptions of stress may vary from person to person, stress has not been\\nparticularly easy to define, and it is very difficult to measure. We will deal with methods of measuring stress\\nshortly.\\nCompanies and managers have become more and more concerned with the effects of stress on workers and\\n253', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 252}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='on important “bottom-line” variables, such as productivity, absenteeism, and turnover. Why all of the interest\\nin worker stress? The most obvious reason is that too much stress can cause illness (Ganster & Rosen, 2013).\\nStress-related illnesses include ulcers, hypertension and coronary heart disease, migraines, asthma attacks, and\\ncolitis. If worker stress leads to stress-related illnesses, rates of absenteeism can increase. At the psychological\\nlevel, stress can cause mental strain, feelings of fatigue, anxiety, and depression that can reduce worker\\nproductivity and quality of work. If a job becomes too stressful, a worker may be compelled to quit and find a\\nless stressful position. Thus, worker stress may influence turnover as well.\\nManagers and workers may also be concerned about stress at a more personal level. Worker stress can be, in\\nmany ways, the flip side of job satisfaction. Whereas job satisfaction represents the “positives” associated with\\nwork, stress is a way of conceptualizing the “negatives” associated with jobs—the pressures, the strains, the\\nconflicts. No doubt, much of the interest in worker stress results from the fact that managers, business owners,\\nand all other sorts of workers experience stress on a day-to-day basis.\\nSources of Worker Stress\\nGenerally, stress can arise from either the environment (situational stress) or from an individual’s personal\\ncharacteristics (dispositional stress). \\nSituational stress\\n can come from all aspects of our lives. We are subjected\\nto a wide range of stressors at home, at school, and in our interpersonal relationships, as well as the stressors\\nwe encounter at work. No doubt, all these various sources of stress accumulate and add to our overall stress\\nlevels. That is, stress at home can spill over to work situations and vice versa. Most stress researchers realize\\nthis and emphasize that when studying stress, it is important to look at the broad picture of an individual’s\\ntotal stress, rather than focusing narrowly on stress derived from work (Erickson, Nichols, & Ritter, 2000;\\nFrone, Russell, & Cooper, 1991).\\nSituational Stress\\n stress arising from certain conditions that exist in the work environment or in the\\nworker’s personal life\\nFor our purposes, however, we will focus primarily on the stress that comes from workplace sources. We\\nwill first examine stressful occupations and then focus on the elements of jobs and of work organizations that\\ncan cause worker stress. Finally, we will look at how worker stress can result from characteristics of the\\nworkers themselves as we examine individual sources of worker stress, or what we might call dispositional\\nstress.\\nStressful Occupations\\nIt is generally believed that certain occupations, such as air traffic controller, physician or other health care\\nprovider, police officer, and firefighter, are particularly stressful. Several years ago there was increased\\nattention to postal workers’ stress following highly publicized cases of postal workers attacking and killing\\ncoworkers. This led to the slang term “going postal.” Is it true that certain occupations are particularly stress\\nprone? There is some evidence to support this. For example, studies of air traffic controllers indicate that they\\ndo indeed experience high levels of work-related stress, as do medical doctors and nurses (Leonhardt & Vogt,\\n2011; Rutledge et al., 2009; Sparks & Cooper, 1999). Similarly, studies of dentists suggest that dentistry is a high-\\nstress occupation (Cooper, Mallinger, & Kahn, 1978; DiMatteo, Shugars, & Hays, 1993). High-level managers\\nand business executives are also believed to hold extremely stressful jobs.\\nPolice officers’, prison guards/officers’, and firefighters’ jobs are particularly stressful because of the physical\\ndangers involved (Chamberlin & Green, 2010; Steiner & \\nWooldridge, 2015; Tehrani & Piper, 2011).

In sum, trying to determine levels of worker stress merely by looking at a\\nperson’s occupation or job title may not be very accurate.\\nResearch on these and other stereotypically stressful occupations has begun to discover exactly why these\\njobs are characterized as stressful. For instance, air traffic controllers’ jobs are stressful because of the heavy\\nworkloads, the constant fear of causing accidents, equipment problems, and poor working environments\\n(Shouksmith & Burrough, 1988). The primary sources of dentists’ occupational stress come from difficult\\npatients, heavy workloads, and the dentists’ own concern that their patients hold negative views about them\\nand about dentists in general (Coster, Carstens, & Harris, 1987; DiMatteo et al., 1993).\\nFigure 10.1\\n \\nAlthough they are often seen as having fewer work responsibilities than physicians, nurses often experience very high levels of work\\nstress.\\nSource:\\n Volkova Vera/\\nShutterstock.com\\nRather than focusing only on high-stress occupations, it makes sense to examine those sources of worker\\nstress that are common to all kinds of jobs, even those that are not typically considered high-stress jobs.

These two types of situational stress—work task and work role stressors—can often be alleviated by\\nmanagement actions.\\nWork Task Stressors\\nWork Overload\\nA common work task source of stress is \\nwork overload,\\n also known as \\nrole overload\\n, which results when the\\njob requires excessive work speed, output, or concentration (Bowling, Alarcon, Bragg, & Hartman, 2015;\\nBrown, Jones, & Leigh, 2005). More recently, attention has been given to technology-related work overload,\\nsuch as the increased volume of information, leading to things such as “e-mail overload” (Bellotti, Ducheneaut,\\nHoward, Smith, & Grinter, 2005; Soucek & Moser, 2010). Work overload is widely believed to be one of the\\ngreatest sources of work stress. Research on work overload indicates that it is related to physiological\\nindicators of stress, such as elevated serum cholesterol and increased heart rate (Caplan & Jones, 1975; Cobb &\\nRose, 1973); to psychological measures of stress (Spector, 1987; Spector, Dwyer, & Jex, 1988); and to lower\\nquality of work and job dissatisfaction (Kirmeyer & Dougherty, 1988). In fact, work overload has been reported\\nas a common source of stress for jobs as diverse as clerical workers, soldiers, air traffic controllers, courtroom\\nattorneys, and health care workers (Bliese & Halverson, 1996; Carayon, 1994; Iverson, Olekalns, & Erwin, 1998;\\nShouksmith & Burrough, 1988).\\nWork Overload\\n a common source of stress resulting when a job requires excessive speed, output, or\\nconcentration\\nUnderutilization\\nWork overload can cause stress, but having too little to do\\n—underutilization—\\n can also be stressful (French &\\nCaplan, 1972; Ganster, Fusilier, & Mayes, 1986). Underutilization may also occur when workers feel that the job\\ndoes not use their work-related knowledge, skills, or abilities or when jobs are boring and monotonous\\n(Melamed, Ben-Avi, Luz, & Green, 1995; Weinberg, 2016). Some college graduates in low-level clerical or\\ncustomer service positions may feel some stress due to under-utilization of their knowledge and skills (French,\\nCaplan, & Harrison, 1982).

Research suggests that\\nsupervisors can play an important part in reducing job uncertainty for subordinates by clarifying job roles and\\nduties (Schaubroeck, Ganster, Sime, & Ditman, 1993). Findings that job uncertainty can have negative\\ninfluences on job satisfaction highlight the importance of the supervisor’s role in alleviating uncertainty and its\\naccompanying stress (O’Driscoll & Beehr, 1994).\\nJob Ambiguity\\n a source of stress resulting from a lack of clearly defined jobs and/or work tasks\\nConflict between roles can also occur and can become an additional source of stress (Greenhaus & Beutell,\\n1985). For instance, a worker’s job may require excessive overtime that conflicts with the worker’s family roles\\nof spouse and parent.

We will discuss\\nroles and role conflict in more depth in \\nChapter 12\\n.\\nLack of Control\\nAnother important source of work stress results from workers sensing that they have little control over the\\nwork environment and over their own work behavior. Stress resulting from this feeling of \\nlack of control\\n is\\nparticularly common in lower-level jobs or in highly structured organizations. Jobs that are so constrained and\\nrule driven that employees are unable to have any sort of input in work decisions and procedures are likely to\\nbe stress inducing, particularly for those workers who want to \\nhave some input (see Dwyer & Ganster, 1991;\\nKarasek, 1979; Theorell, Westerlund, Alfredsson, & Oxenstierna, 2005). Research indicates that providing\\nworkers with a sense of control over their work environment through techniques such as giving them a voice\\nin decision-making processes or allowing them to plan their own work tasks, reduces work stress and fatigue\\nand increases job satisfaction (Jackson, 1983; Jimmieson & Terry, 1998; Sonnentag & Zijlstra, 2006). On the\\nother hand, some studies suggest that a sense of a lack of control over one’s job may not be stressful for many\\nworkers (see Carayon, 1994). It may be the case that different types of workers are more or less concerned with\\nhaving a sense of control over their jobs (recall our discussion in \\nChapter 8\\n on the job characteristics model\\nand individual differences in workers’ desire for autonomy). In fact, research has found that certain personality\\ncharacteristics may determine whether or not an individual is stressed by a perceived lack of job control\\n(Ivancevich, Matteson, & Preston, 1982).\\nLack of Control\\n a feeling of having little input or effect on the job and/or work environment; typically\\nresults in stress\\nPhysical Work Conditions\\nPhysical conditions in the work environment are another organizational source contributing to worker stress\\n(Frese & Zapf, 1988). Jobs that must be performed under extreme temperatures, loud and distracting noise, or\\npoor lighting or ventilation can be quite stressful. Dangerous jobs that place workers at risk of loss of health,\\nlife, or limb are an additional source of work stress (Booth, 1986). Cramped, crowded, and excessively noisy\\nwork environments can also cause stress (Ashkanasy, Ayoko, & Jehn, 2014). For example, one study showed\\nthat noise levels in open-space office environments (offices with partitioned cubicles and open ceilings)\\nconstituted a significant source of stress (Evans & Johnson, 2000). Similarly, working late night (“graveyard”)\\nshifts can disrupt natural sleep and waking cycles and may lead to problems such as high stress, fatigue, job\\n257', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 256}),\n",

Having a harsh, critical boss with a punitive management style would likely be stressful for\\njust about anyone. With the rise of virtual work, some workers feel a lack of social connections and support\\nand experience a stressful sense of social isolation (Avolio & Kahai, 2003; Wiesenfeld, Raghuram, & Garud,\\n2001).\\nInterpersonal Stress\\n stress arising from difficulties with others in the workplace\\nInterpersonal stress can also result when coworkers are placed in some sort of conflict situation. Imagine, for\\nexample, that two employees are both being considered for an important promotion. A great deal of stress may\\nbe generated if the two individuals must work together while both are competing for the same honor. There is\\nalso evidence that organizational politics and struggles over power can be important sources of stress in the\\nworkplace (Ferris, Frink, Gilmore, & Kacmar, 1994). We will discuss power and politics in depth in \\nChapter 14\\n.\\nWhatever its causes, the inability to get along with other workers is one of the most common sources of stress\\nin the workplace (Matteson & Ivancevich, 1987).\\nFigure 10.2\\n Attentive supervisors may play an important part in reducing job uncertainty, thus reducing job stress.\\nSource:\\n toddmedia/iStock\\nAnother form of interpersonal stress occurs frequently in service organizations and involves the stress of\\nproviding good customer service. When one is dealing with impatient and difficult customers, the pressure to\\nmaintain one’s cool and offer service with a smile can be quite taxing and stressful. Researchers have examined\\nthis \\nemotional labor\\n—the demands of regulating and controlling emotions and emotional displays as part of a\\njob requirement (Diefendorff & Gosserand, 2003; Hochschild, 1983). The very common stress caused by\\nemotional labor can cause workers to become dissatisfied and cynical about their jobs, reduce job satisfaction,\\naffect performance, and lead to frequent absenteeism and turnover (Bono & Vey, 2005; Hulsheger, Lang, &\\nMaier, 2010; Rubin, Tardino, Daus, & Munz, 2005).\\nEmotional Labor\\n the demands of regulating and controlling emotions in the workplace\\n258', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 257}),\n",

Research has suggested that\\nvictims of workplace sexual harassment, as well as victims of more general harassment at work, including\\nbullying (see the box “On the Cutting Edge”), have increased odds of work-related illness, injury, or being\\nassaulted (Rospenda, Richman, Ehmke, & Zlatoper, 2005). A study of over 6,000 telephone company employees\\nacross the U.S. showed that incidence of sexual harassment increased stress and decreased job satisfaction, but\\nthe culture of the organization/unit in terms of whether the culture fostered and appeared to tolerate\\nharassment or discouraged it also played a part in levels of employee stress (Law, Dollard, Tuckey, &\\nDormann, 2011; Mueller, De Coster, & Estes, 2001).

(We will spend a great deal of\\ntime on organizational change in \\nChapter 15\\n.) People tend to grow accustomed to certain work procedures and\\ncertain work structures, and they resist change. Most of us prefer things to remain stable and predictable. Such\\nstability in our working environments seems comforting and reassuring. Therefore, it should not be surprising\\nthat major changes in a work organization tend to cause stress (Dahl, 2011; Leiter & Harvie, 1998). Some\\ncommon change situations that lead to worker stress include company reorganizations, mergers of one\\ncompany with another or acquisitions of one organization by another, changes in work systems and work\\ntechnology, changes in company policy, and managerial or personnel changes (see \\nTable 10.1\\n; Judge, Thoresen,\\nPucik, & Welbourne, 1999; Wanberg & Banas, 2000). For example, research has shown that physiological stress\\nresponses are stronger in novel or unfamiliar circumstances that involve a threat or challenge (Rose, \\n1987). An\\nevent like a company-wide reorganization or a merger or acquisition would certainly be perceived as\\nthreatening and stressful by many employees (Marks & Mirvis, 2010). Coping with the loss of a job or potential\\njob loss is another major stressor (Moore, Grunberg, & Greenberg, 2006; Prussia, Fugate, & Kinicki, 2001).\\nWork–Family Conflict\\nA very important source of stress, one that extends beyond the boundaries of the organization, is \\nwork–family\\nconflict,\\n which results from efforts to balance the often-competing demands of work roles and requirements\\nand those of family and nonworking life. A great deal of attention has been devoted to research on work–\\nfamily conflict and efforts to achieve balance between the world of work and the world of family (Halpern &\\nMurphy, 2005; Kossek & Lambert, 2005).

Targets of bullies report anxiety, fear, depression, and in extreme cases suffer a\\npost-traumatic stress disorder (Namie & Namie, 2009). The cost of workplace bullying to organizations in\\nterms of reduced productivity and increased absenteeism and turnover likely runs into the billions of\\ndollars (Paludi, 2015).\\nBecause many of the targets of workplace bullies are not members of protected groups, there is often\\nno legal recourse, and many witnesses of workplace bullying don’t speak up for fear they will be targeted\\nthemselves. Some countries have begun to enact legislation to combat workplace bullying, including\\nAustralia, Canada, and several European nations. In the U.S. there is a movement to enact the Healthy\\nWorkplace bill, but antibullying legislation has not reached the federal level, despite being considered by\\nseveral states.\\nThere has been an increase in research on workplace bullying. One study noted that targets of\\nworkplace bullying become emotionally depleted, which affects their motivation and can lead to\\ndisengagement at work (Tuckey & Neall, 2014). Targets of bullying can also experience severe stress\\nreactions, including psychological and physical illness (Hogh, Mikkelsen, & Hansen, 2012). For example,\\nin Australia, where combating workplace bullying is a priority, it was estimated that bullying led to\\ndepression, which cost hundreds of millions of dollars annually in increased absenteeism and lost\\nproductivity (McTernan, Dollard, & La Montagne, 2013).\\nIndividual Sources of Work Stress: Dispositional Stressors\\nAlthough a great deal of worker stress is created by factors in the organization or by features of jobs and work\\ntasks, some is caused by characteristics of the workers themselves. We will consider two such individual\\nsources of work stress: the Type A behavior pattern and the susceptibility to stress and to stress effects. It is the\\nindividual worker—not management—who must work to alleviate these sources of stress.\\nType A Behavior Pattern\\nWhen many people think of individuals who are extremely stressed in the workplace, they immediately picture\\nthe stereotypical hard-driving, competitive executive who seeks a job with a heavy workload and many\\nresponsibilities—a person who takes on too much work and never seems to have enough time to do it. Is there\\nany truth to this characterization? Research evidence indicates that there is. Researchers have uncovered the\\nType A behavior pattern,\\n or Type A personality, which is characterized by excessive drive and\\ncompetitiveness, a sense of urgency and impatience, and underlying hostility (\\nTable 10.2\\n; Friedman &\\nRosenman, 1974; Rosenman, 1978). This behavior pattern is particularly significant because there is evidence\\nthat persons who possess the Type A personality are slightly more prone to develop stress-related coronary\\n260', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 259}),\n",

Early research on Type A behavior hypothesized that it was the Type A’s hardworking, competitive\\ndrive that caused stress and subsequent heart problems (Rosenman et al., 1964). Later research, however,\\nsuggested that the Type A’s underlying hostility, and the lack of appropriate expression of that hostility, is also\\npartly responsible for increased stress reactions in Type As (Dembroski & Costa, 1987; Friedman, Hall, &\\nHarris, 1985; Smith & Pope, 1990). Other studies suggest that the more global construct of “negative\\naffectivity,” or the expression of negative emotions, such as anger, hostility, anxiety, impatience, and\\naggression, is what combines with a Type A personality to increase stress-related health risks (Chen & Spector,\\n1991; Ganster, Schaubroeck, Sime, & Mayes, 1991). (We will discuss negative affectivity in more depth later.)\\nTable 10.2\\n Type A Behavior Pattern\\nTwo popular self-report instruments are designed to assess Type A behavior. They are the Jenkins Activity\\nSurvey (JAS; Jenkins, Zyzanski, & Rosenman, 1979) and the Framingham Type A Scale (FTAS; Haynes,\\nFeinleib, Levine, Scotch, & Kannel, 1978). Following are examples of questions that determine Type A\\nbehavior:\\n• Are you a hard-driving and competitive person?\\n• Do you always seem pressed for time to get errands done?\\n• Are you the type of person who has a strong desire to excel and accomplish things?\\n• Are you impatient when you have to wait for service?\\n• Are you the kind of person who gets easily irritated?\\n• Would other people consider you bossy?\\n• Is your temper sometimes fiery and hard to control?\\n• Do you often feel like there is too much to do and not enough time to do it?\\nAffirmative answers to these questions indicates a Type A behavior pattern.\\nDo Type As experience more stress than others? Research into this question has produced mixed results. For\\nexample, some studies indicate that Type As are more likely to experience or report high stress than are other\\npersonality types under the same workload (Kirmeyer & Dougherty, 1988; Payne, Jabri, & Pearson, 1988). Other\\nstudies show that Type As do not report or experience greater stress, but simply have stronger physiological\\nstress reactions to stressful situations (Ganster, 1986). Perhaps the subjective experience of stress has less\\nnegative influence on health than the physiological responses. In other words, Type As may have stronger\\nstress-induced physiological responses that they are not necessarily aware of, and it is these strong\\nphysiological responses over time that lead to increased health risks. If this is the case, Type A’s may simply\\nnot realize that their long, intense work style is creating wear and tear on their bodies.\\nStop \\n&\\n Review\\nList and define five organizational/situational sources of worker stress.\\nAlthough there are obvious stress-related costs to the Type A behavior pattern, there are also some gains.\\nStudies consistently show that Type As tend to work harder (Byrne & Reinhardt, 1989), work well in high-\\nvariety jobs (Lee, Earley, & Hanson, 1988), and have higher positions and salaries than Type Bs (Boyd, 1984;\\nChesney & Rosenman, 1980; Payne et al., 1988).

       " Document(page_content='strong achievement orientation or “workaholism” discussed in the motivation chapter (see \\nChapter 8\\n, the “Up\\nClose” box).\\nAn important question is whether the Type A behavior pattern is something related to Western or U.S. work\\nculture or whether Type As occur in other countries and cultures. Although there is some evidence that other\\ncultures have Type A and Type B workers (e.g., Jamal, 1999; Li & Shen, 2009), there are most certainly\\ndifferences across cultures and countries in the prevalence and rates of the Type A behavior pattern (Al-\\nMashaan, 2003).\\nSusceptibility/Resistance to Stress\\nAnother dispositional source of stress may stem from the fact that some persons are simply more susceptible to\\nstress, whereas others have stress-resistant, hardy personalities. The concept of \\nhardiness\\n was outlined by\\npsychologist Suzanne Kobasa (1982; Maddi & Kobasa, 1984), who argued that hardy personality types are\\nresistant to the harmful effects of stress because of their style of dealing with stressful events. A meta-analysis\\nshows that hardy individuals experience less stress and are better at coping with stress than nonhardy\\nindividuals (Eschleman, Bowling, & Alarcon, 2010). Rather than \\nviewing a stressful situation as a threat, hardy\\ntypes view it as a challenge and derive meaning from these challenging experiences (Britt, Adler, & Bartone,\\n2001). Moreover, they also believe that they can control and influence the course of their lives (recall that a\\nsense of lack of control can contribute to stress) and are committed to their jobs. Conversely, a lack of\\nhardiness is associated with higher levels of self-perceived stress, and there is evidence that such “unhardy” or\\n“disease-prone” persons may be more susceptible to stress-related illnesses and depression (Friedman & Booth-\\nKewley, 1987; Kobasa & Puccetti, 1983). Thus, it appears that certain types of workers are more “stress prone.”\\nThat is, they are more likely to suffer stress-related physical illness and psychological symptoms (depression,\\nanxiety, etc.) than are more hardy workers.\\nHardiness\\n the notion that some people may be more resistant to the health-damaging effects of stress\\nThere have been attempts to increase hardiness through what has been called HardiTraining (Khoshaba &\\nMaddi, 2001). In essence, training for hardiness actually involves the development of workers’ coping skills and\\na combination of relaxation training, a program of diet and exercise, and developing supportive networks to\\nhelp reduce stress (Maddi & Khoshaba, 2003). More recently, hardiness training was found to be successful in\\nhelping college students deal with the stresses of college life (Maddi, Harvey, Khoshaba, Fazel, & Resurreccion,\\n2009). We will examine other programs to cope with stress later in this chapter.\\nSelf-Efficacy\\nResearch has also identified another characteristic that seems to increase resistance to stress: self-efficacy. \\nSelf-\\nefficacy\\n is defined as an individual’s beliefs in his or her abilities to engage in courses of action that will lead\\nto desired outcomes (Bandura, 1997a). In other words, self-efficacy is related to one’s sense of competence and\\neffectiveness. Self-efficacy is a very important concept that not only relates to one’s ability to cope with\\nstressful situations (i.e., the possession of \\ncoping\\n self-efficacy), but it is also an important factor relating to a\\nworker’s ability to perform his or her job (\\njob-related\\n self-efficacy), to lead a work team (\\nleadership\\n self-\\nefficacy), and to deal effectively with relationships at work (\\nrelationship\\n self-efficacy). There is evidence that a\\nsense of self-efficacy can have positive effects in reducing stress in the workplace (Jex & Bliese, 1999;\\nRennesund & Saksvik, 2010; Saks, 1994; Van Yperen, 1998). In one study, it was found that having a sense of\\ncontrol over a stressful work situation only decreased stress if the employees had a high sense of self-efficacy\\nabout their abilities to do their jobs under stress and strain (Jimmieson, 2000).\\n262', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 261}),\n",

For the most part,\\nmeasurement of stress in general, and of worker stress in particular, is problematic. There have been a number\\nof approaches to measuring stress. We will consider several of these.\\nPhysiological Measures\\nAs has been stated, the stress response involves physiological reactions as well as psychological and emotional\\nresponses. Therefore, one strategy for measuring stress has focused on measuring signs of physiological arousal\\nand strain that accompany stress. This includes blood pressure monitoring, electrocardiogram (EKG) for\\nmonitoring heart rate, or blood tests for monitoring levels of certain hormones, such as the stress-linked\\nhormone, cortisol, and cholesterol in the bloodstream. One problem with using such physiological indicators of\\nstress is the amount of variation that can occur from hour to hour, day to day, or person to person (Herd, 1988).\\nAnother drawback to the use of such stress tests is the requirement for trained medical personnel, as well as\\nthe associated costs for equipment and analysis procedures.\\nSelf-Report Assessments\\nAnother approach to measuring stress, one that is favored by psychologists, is to ask people directly to report\\non their own perceived stress through various rating scales. Most self-report assessments fall into one of two\\nmajor categories: reports about organizational conditions or reports about psychological and/or physical states.\\nReports on organizational conditions typically contain items that ask about facets of the job such as\\nautonomy, feedback, task identity, task significance, skill variety, complexity, dealing with others, ambiguity,\\nand workload (Spector, 1992). For example, questions dealing with workload might include the following\\n(Matteson & Ivancevich, 1987):\\n❚\\n\\u2003\\nNumber of projects/assignments you have.\\n❚\\n\\u2003\\nAmount of time spent in meetings.\\n❚\\n\\u2003\\nAmount of time spent at work.\\n❚\\n\\u2003\\nNumber of phone calls and visitors you have during the day.\\nThere are several standardized self-report measures of psychological and physiological stress and strain, such\\nas the \\nStress Diagnostic Survey\\n (\\nSDS\\n; Ivancevich & Matteson, 1980), the \\nOccupational Stress Indicator\\n (\\nOSI\\n;\\nCooper, Sloan, & Williams, 1988), and the \\nJob Stress Survey\\n (\\nJSS\\n; Spielberger & Reheiser, 1994). For example,\\nthe SDS measures workers’ perceptions of stress in 15 work-related areas, including time pressure, workload,\\nrole ambiguity, and supervisory style. The JSS is a 30-item instrument that measures the severity and\\nfrequency with which workers experience certain stressful working conditions.

Particularly\\nimportant is the worker’s experience of traumatic or \\nstressful life events,\\n which include negative events such\\nas the death of a spouse or loved one, divorce or separation, major illness, and financial or legal troubles, as\\nwell as positive events such as marriage, the birth of a child, and vacations.

For example, it has been suggested that a simple additive weighting of the Social\\nReadjustment Rating Scale does not accurately assess the effect of an additional stressful event when an\\nindividual is already experiencing other stressful events (Birnbaum & Sotoodeh, 1991). In addition, assessment\\nof stressful life events may not reveal the impact of day-to-day stressors influencing the individual.\\nMeasurement of Person–Environment Fit\\nPerson–environment (P–E) fit\\n refers to the match between a worker’s abilities, needs, and values and\\norganizational demands, rewards, and values. P–E fit has been found to have a positive correlation with\\norganizational commitment and well-being and a negative correlation with turnover (Hult, 2005; Ostroff,\\n1993b; Verquer, Beehr, & Wagner, 2003; Yang, Che, & Spector, 2008). According to the P–E fit approach, a\\nmismatch between the worker and the work organization/environment is believed to be a primary cause of\\nworker stress. For example, imagine a worker who has a high need for job clarification, job structure, and\\nfeedback and who accepts a job with a small, fast-growing company where jobs are neither well defined nor\\nstructured and where supervisors have little time for feedback due to constant production demands. In such a\\ncase, there would be a poor person–environment fit.\\nPerson–Environment (P–E) Fit\\n the match between a worker’s abilities, needs, and values and\\norganizational demands, rewards, and values\\nTypically, measurement of person–environment fit involves measuring some characteristics of the worker,\\nsuch as worker skills and/or abilities, and assessing the work environment and job demands. The discrepancy\\nbetween these two sets of measures is then calculated as an index of fit (e.g., Edwards & Cooper, 1990). It can\\nbe argued, however, that the concept of person–environment fit is overly broad and that measures that\\nspecifically look at “subcategories” of P–E fit—such as person–organization fit, person–job fit, and the extent to\\nwhich a particular job fits an individual’s motivational needs (see \\nChapter 8\\n)—are needed (see Kristoff, 1996;\\nMedcof & Hausdorf, 1995; Sutherland, Fogarty, & Pithers, 1995).\\nEffects of Worker Stress\\nMuch of the growing interest in worker stress (it is one of the most studied areas of I/O psychology) is due to\\nthe very powerful impact that it can have on workers and \\nwork behavior and, most dramatically, on employee\\nhealth. It is believed that more than one half of all physical illnesses are stress related. Some common stress-\\nrelated illnesses are ulcers, colitis, high blood pressure, heart disease, respiratory illnesses, and migraine\\nheadaches. Moreover, stress can worsen common colds, flus, and infections, making recovery time longer. It is\\nestimated that these illnesses, attributed in part to work stress, cost billions of dollars annually in health care\\ncosts and in employee absenteeism and turnover (Beehr & Bhagat, 1985; Clark, 2005; Hart & Cooper, 2001).\\nImportantly, polls of workers show that the majority believes that job stress causes them problems (Clark,\\n2005).\\nWorker stress can also have an adverse impact on employees’ psychological states. High levels of stress are\\nassociated with depression, anxiety, and chronic fatigue. Stress may also contribute to alcoholism and drug\\nabuse in workers and may influence accident rates on the job (Frone, 2008; Wolf, S., 1986; we will discuss these\\nin more depth later in this chapter). Emotional exhaustion, detachment from coworkers, negative self-\\nevaluations, and lowered self-esteem are also associated with worker stress (Cordes & Dougherty, 1993).\\n265', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 264}),\n",

Stress is believed to cause\\ndecreased work performance and increased absenteeism and turnover. However, the relationships between\\nwork stress and these key bottom-line variables are quite complex. For example, it has been suggested that the\\nrelationship between stress and performance may often take the form of an inverted U (see \\nFigure 10.3\\n), rather\\nthan \\nbeing direct and linear, with greater stress leading to poorer performance. In other words, very low levels\\nof stress (or no stress) and very high levels of stress are associated with poor work performance, whereas low\\nto moderate levels of stress seem to be related to better performance (Cohen, 1980; Muse, Harris, & Field, 2003).\\nThis makes sense, because very high levels of stress will interfere with job performance. For instance, there is\\nevidence that severe, acute stress results in poor performance because stress interferes with workers’ mental\\nprocessing (Ellis, 2006). On the other end, having little or no stress likely means that workers are not being\\nchallenged or motivated (LePine, Podsakoff, & LePine, 2005). In short, a little bit of stress might not be a bad\\nthing. Of course, both stress and job performance are extremely complex variables, and this inverted U\\nrelationship may not hold for all types of stressors or for all aspects of job performance (Beehr, 1985).\\nThe effects of work stress on job performance might also be affected by other variables. For example, one\\nstudy showed that the effect of stress on the job performance of nurses was mediated by feelings of depression.\\nThat is, work stress caused the nurses to be depressed, and the depression led to decreased quality of patient\\ncare and problems with relationships with coworkers (Motowidlo, Packard, & Manning, 1986). If stress is\\ncaused by an inability to get along with a certain coworker, an employee may try to cope with this situation by\\navoiding all interactions with the individual. This avoidance strategy may impair the employee’s job\\nperformance if the coworker has some valuable information that the employee needs to perform his or her job.\\nIn this case, it is not the stress that is causing poor job performance, but the coping strategy!\\nA great deal of evidence suggests that work stress can lead to increased turnover/turnover intentions and\\nabsenteeism (Boswell & Olson-Buchanan, 2004; Mayes & Ganster, 1988; Thorsteinsson, Brown, & Richards,\\n2014). Gupta and Beehr (1979) found this to be true for a variety of occupations in five organizations. Another\\nstudy concluded that it was a combination of high levels of work stress and low levels of organizational\\n266', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 265}),\n",

Further, if stress levels are to blame for certain illnesses, it is a given that stress must be\\nresponsible for some absenteeism and some turnover caused by disabling illness.\\nJob Burnout\\nEmployees exposed to such things as unresolved interpersonal conflicts, lack of clearly defined work tasks and\\nresponsibilities, extreme overwork, lack of appropriate rewards, or presence of inappropriate punishment may\\nbecome victims of \\nburnout,\\n a process by which they become less committed to their jobs and begin to\\nwithdraw from work. The process of withdrawal may include such reactions as increased tardiness and\\nabsenteeism and decreased work performance and work quality (Gaines & Jermier, 1983; Sutherland & Cooper,\\n1988; Ybema, Smulders, & Bongers, 2010). Moreover, work-related burnout can spill over to an individual’s\\nfamily life, as we saw with stress earlier (Maslach, 2005; Maslach, Schaufeli, & Leiter, 2001).\\nBurnout\\n a syndrome resulting from prolonged exposure to work stress that leads to withdrawal from the\\norganization\\nBurnout usually occurs in three phases. The first phase is \\nemotional exhaustion\\n caused by excessive\\ndemands placed on the worker. The second phase is \\ndepersonalization\\n, or the development of a cynical,\\ninsensitive attitude toward people (other workers or customers) in the work site. The third phase is marked by\\nfeelings of \\nlow personal accomplishment\\n. Here the burned-out workers feel a sense of frustration and\\nhelplessness. They begin to believe that their work efforts fail to produce the desired results, and they may quit\\ntrying (Jackson, Schwab, & Schuler, 1986; Lee & Ashforth, 1990). \\nTable 10.4\\n presents sample items from the\\nMaslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey (MBI; Maslach & Jackson, 1986), an instrument that\\nassesses the three hypothesized components of burnout.\\nTable 10.4\\n \\nSample Items from the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBIHSS)\\n267', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 266}),\n",

A study of nurses found that burnout led to\\ndecreased organizational commitment and increased negative interactions with supervisors (Leiter & Maslach,\\n1988). Similarly, the effects of burnout on teachers include insensitivity toward students, lower tolerance for\\ndisruption in the classroom, inadequate preparation for classes, and the feeling that they are no longer able to\\nhelp students learn (\\nFigure 10.4\\n) (Byrne, 1993). A longitudinal study of social welfare workers found that the\\nemotional exhaustion component of Maslach’s Burnout Inventory was related to both voluntary turnover and\\ndeclines in job performance over a one-year period (Wright & Cropanzano, 1998). Although much of the\\nresearch on burnout focuses on the “helping professions,” there is evidence that burnout can occur in many\\ndifferent occupations (Leiter & Schaufeli, 1996; Sonnentag, Brodbeck, Heinbokel, & Stolte, 1994).

For instance, researchers have disagreed about the number of components that\\ncomprise the burnout syndrome (Demerouti, Bakker, Nachreiner, & Schaufeli, 2001; Evans & Fischer, 1993;\\nSchaufeli & Van Dierendonck, 1993).

Individual strategies are those\\nthat can be used by individual employees to try to reduce or eliminate personal stress. Organizational strategies\\nare techniques and programs that organizations can implement to try to reduce stress levels for groups of\\nworkers or for the organization as a whole.\\nIndividual Coping Strategies\\nIndividual coping strategies\\n are behavioral or cognitive efforts made in an attempt to manage internal\\ndemands and conflicts that have exceeded an individual’s usual coping resources (Lazarus & Launier, 1978;\\nSethi & Schuler, 1984). The most obvious of such techniques are programs developed to improve the\\nindividual’s physical condition, such as exercise and diet plans. The primary rationale behind such health\\nprograms is to make the body more resistant to stress-related illnesses. Some claim that exercise itself may\\ndirectly reduce the anxiety associated with stress or that it may have a certain tranquilizing effect on stressed\\nindividuals (Jette, 1984). However, it is unclear whether it is the exercise that directly alleviates the\\nphysiological symptoms of stress or simply that an individual “feels good” after exercising because of positive\\npsychological factors. For instance, because exercising and keeping physically fit are valued highly by our\\nculture, it may be that physically active persons feel better about themselves and thus psychologically reduce\\nperceived stress. More rigorous evaluation is needed to determine the precise physiological and psychological\\ninfluences of exercise and diet programs in alleviating stress.\\nIndividual Coping Strategies\\n techniques such as exercise, meditation, or cognitive restructuring that can\\nbe used to deal with work stress\\n269', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 268}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Another individual coping strategy is the inducement of states of relaxation to reduce the negative arousal\\nand strain that accompany stress. A variety of techniques have been used to achieve this, including systematic\\nrelaxation training, meditation, and biofeedback (Stein, 2001). In systematic relaxation training, individuals are\\ntaught how to relax all the muscles of the body systematically, from the feet to the face. Meditation is a deep\\nrelaxed state that is usually brought on by intense concentration on a single word, idea, or object. Supposedly,\\nmeditative states are “free of anxiety, tension, or distress” (Sethi, 1984a, p. 145). Biofeedback uses some measure\\nof physiological activity, typically brain waves or muscle tension, that is associated with relaxed states. When\\nthe person is in the state of relaxation, the measurement machinery provides some sort of feedback, such as a\\ntone. The individual then learns through practice how to enter into the relaxed, stress-free state. Although\\nrelaxation, meditation, and biofeedback are intended principally to reduce the physiological arousal associated\\nwith stress, they may also induce positive psychological reactions to stress.\\nThese various methods of coping with stress through relaxation processes are widely touted, but there has\\nbeen very little systematic investigation of their effectiveness. In fact, some findings indicate that such\\nprograms are not very effective at all (Ganster, Mayes, Sime, & Tharp, 1982; Sallis, Johnson, Trevorrow, Hovell,\\n& Kaplan, 1985).\\nOne possible reason why systematic relaxation coping strategies may not be effective is that most of the\\nrelaxation techniques require quite a bit of dedication and practice to be used effectively. Not all persons find it\\neasy to induce a deeply relaxed state; others may not be able to adhere to a regular program of systematic\\nrelaxation or meditation. Also, many of these programs last only a few hours, which may not be enough time\\nto teach someone difficult relaxation techniques. The timing of the relaxation technique is another problem.\\nMany people would find it difficult (and perhaps inappropriate) to meditate at work, and relaxing before or\\nafter work may or may not significantly reduce stress while at work. The same argument can be made for\\nexercise programs—the benefits will only occur if people adhere to their exercise regimens (see Erfurt, Foote, &\\nHeirich, 1992). In short, although any and all of these techniques may be good in theory, they may not function\\nwell in practice.\\nOther individual coping strategies include a variety of techniques to try to fend off work stress through\\nbetter, more efficient work methods. Courses in time management are often advertised as methods of reducing\\nstress caused by overwork and inefficiency (Schuler & Sethi, 1984; Wratcher & Jones, 1986). For example,\\nlearning to approach work tasks systematically by budgeting and assigning parcels of time to specific tasks and\\nby planning ahead to avoid last-minute deadlines may be quite effective in helping reduce stress for some\\nworkers. Again, however, these strategies depend on the individual’s commitment to the technique and\\nwillingness and ability to use it regularly (Shahani, Weiner, & Streit, 1993). (See “Applying I/O Psychology” for\\nguidelines on how organizations should implement stress management programs.)\\nIndividuals may also try to cope with stress by removing themselves, temporarily or permanently, from the\\nstressful work situation (Fritz et al., 2013). It is not uncommon for workers to exchange a stressful job for one\\nthat is less stressful (although many do seek more challenging and more stressful jobs). Although a vacation\\nmay temporarily eliminate work stress, certain trips, such as intense tours of eight European countries in seven\\ndays, may create a different kind of stress themselves (Lounsbury & Hoopes, 1986). Research indicates that\\nalthough vacations do indeed reduce work stress and feelings of burnout, the effects are temporary. In fact,\\nlevels of stress and burnout are reduced immediately before, during, and immediately after the vacation, but\\nmay go back to original levels a few weeks after the vacation (Etzion, 2003; Westman & Eden, 1997).\\nIt is interesting to note that workers might use absence from work—voluntarily taking a day off—as a coping\\nstrategy. If absence is used as an attempt to cope with a particularly stressful job, then the lost work time must\\nbe balanced against the possible gains in terms of the employee’s long-term performance and well-being\\n(Hackett & Bycio, 1996).\\nAnother strategy uses cognitive efforts to cope, which may include cognitive restructuring, which entails\\nchanging the way one thinks about stressors (Lazarus, 1991; Lowe & Bennett, 2003; Wright, Mohr, Sinclair, &\\nYang, 2015). For example, instead of thinking negative thoughts when faced with a stressor, the individual\\npractices thinking neutral or positive thoughts (e.g., “this is not important,” “this is really a challenge”). Studies\\nof teachers and nurses who used cognitive restructuring found that it reduced their perceptions of stress and\\nstress-related illnesses (Begley, 1998; Gardner, Rose, Mason, Tyler, & Cushway, 2005; Schonfeld, 1990).\\nCognitive restructuring is often used to treat post-traumatic stress disorder in workers and others who have\\n270', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 269}),\n",

These programs take different forms, but many of them involve some sort of cognitive\\ntraining, including mindfulness training, improving emotional awareness and regulation of emotions, and\\ndeveloping a sense of self-efficacy. Resilience training programs range from a few hours to multiweek\\nprograms. Meta-analyses of resilience training programs’ effectiveness have concluded that they have small,\\nbut significant beneficial effects in reducing stress and, in some cases, leading to improved performance\\n(Robertson, Cooper, Sarkar, & Curran, 2015; Vanhove et al., 2016). As you might expect, resilience training\\nprograms work best when they are conducted at the individual, as opposed to the group, level and when the\\namount of training time is extensive.\\nIndividual coping strategies may be effective in combating stress if they increase an individual’s self-efficacy\\nfor coping with stress. Research shows that self-efficacy can help cope with work demands, such as work\\noverload, but only if the person has the resources to help reduce the job demands (Jex, Bliese, Buzzell, &\\nPrimeau, 2001). On the downside, individual coping strategies can be expensive and labor intensive. In\\naddition, success is dependent on the individual’s motivation and ability to learn coping strategies.\\nOrganizational Coping Strategies\\nIndividual coping strategies are steps that workers themselves can take to alleviate personal stress, and\\norganizational coping strategies\\n are steps that organizations can take to try to reduce stress levels in the\\norganization for all, or most, employees (Burke, 1993). Because work stress can come from a variety of\\norganizational sources, there are many things that organizations can do to reduce situational stressors in the\\nworkplace. These strategies include the following:\\nOrganizational Coping Strategies\\n techniques that organizations can use to reduce stress for all or most\\nemployees\\nImprove the person–job fit\\n—We have already seen that work stress commonly arises when workers are in\\njobs they dislike or jobs for which they are ill suited (French & Caplan, 1972).\\nApplying I/O Psychology:\\nDesigning Effective Work Stress Management Training Programs\\nA wide range of programs are used to help employees manage work stress. According to leading\\nresearchers, such programs must follow certain guidelines to ensure their effectiveness: they must be\\nsystematic; they must teach knowledge, skills, or attitudes that are useful in coping with stress; and their\\nsuccess must be evaluated and documented (Matteson & Ivancevich, 1987; Munz & Kohler, 1997).\\nThe first step in designing a stress management program is the same as in designing any sort of\\ntraining program: an assessment of training needs. An organizational stress analysis is needed and might\\ninclude answering such questions as: What are the major producers of stress in the organization? Do\\nthese stress-ors necessarily detract from the accomplishment of organizational goals? (In other words, are\\nthey “bad”?) What sort of resources will be committed to the training program?\\nAccording to Matteson and Ivancevich, most stress management programs take one of two forms:\\nknowledge acquisition programs or skill training programs. Knowledge acquisition programs provide\\nparticipants with some information about stress and a number of coping techniques.

Unfortunately, these “one-shot”\\ntraining programs may not be as effective as the more involved skill training programs in alleviating\\nwork stress (Hemingway & Smith, 1999).\\nSkill training programs are designed to improve specific coping skills in areas such as problem solving,\\ntime management, communication, social interaction, cognitive coping, or strategies for making changes\\nin lifestyle. An example of a step-by-step problem-solving skill program developed by Wasik (1984) is\\nillustrated next:\\n1\\n. \\nIdentify problem (What is my problem?)\\n2\\n. \\nSelect goals (What do I want to accomplish by solving the problem?)\\n3\\n. \\nGenerate alternatives (What else can I do?)\\n4\\n. \\nReview the consequences (What might happen?)\\n5\\n. \\nMake a decision (What is my decision?)\\n6\\n. \\nImplement the decision (Did I do what I decided?)\\n7\\n. \\nEvaluate the decision (Does it work?)\\nThis step-by-step program would be conducted in a series of one- to two-hour sessions over many weeks.\\nParticipants learn each of the steps, practice them using role-playing, and receive feedback concerning\\ntheir skill \\ndevelopment. They are also encouraged to use the skills to deal with actual work problems and\\nthen report back to discuss the success or failure of the strategy. The key to these programs is to practice\\nusing and applying the coping strategies to real and simulated stressful situations.\\nThe final stage in any stress management program is to evaluate its effectiveness. Too often, stress\\nmanagement programs are not properly evaluated (Loo, 1994). It has been suggested that an assessment\\nshould consider trainees’ reactions; how well the program accomplished its immediate objectives; actual\\nbehavioral changes; the impact of the program on organizational outcomes such as productivity,\\nabsenteeism, morale, and employee health; and the cost effectiveness of the program (Kirkpatrick, 1976).\\nA mismatch between a worker’s interests or skills and job requirements can be very stressful. By\\nmaximizing the person–job fit through the careful screening, selection, and placement of employees,\\norganizations can alleviate a great deal of this stress.\\nImprove employee training and orientation programs\\n—Perhaps the most stressed groups of workers in any organization are new employees.\\nAlthough they are usually highly motivated and want to make a good impression on their new bosses by showing that they are hardworking\\nand competent, their lack of certain job-related skills and knowledge means that new employees are often unable to perform their jobs as well\\nas they would like. This mismatch between expectations and outcomes can be very stressful for new workers. Moreover, they feel a great deal\\nof stress simply because they are in a new and unfamiliar environment in which there is much important information to be learned.\\nCompanies can help eliminate some of this stress by ensuring that new workers receive proper job training and orientation to the\\norganization. Not only does this lead to a more capable and productive new workforce, but it also helps to reduce the stress-induced turnover\\nof new employees.\\nIncrease employees’ sense of control\\n—We have seen that the lack of a sense of control over one’s job can be very stressful. By giving workers a\\ngreater feeling of control through participation in work-related decisions, more responsibility, or increased autonomy and independence,\\norganizations can alleviate some of this stress (Caplan, Cobb, French, Harrison, & Pinneau, 1980; Ganster, Fox, & Dwyer, 2001; Jimmieson &\\nTerry, 1993; Schaubroeck, Jones, & Xie, 2001). Programs such as job enrichment, participative decision making, and systems of delegating\\nauthority all help increase employees’ sense of control over their jobs and the work environment.\\n272', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 271}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Eliminate punitive management\\n—It is well known that humans react strongly when they are punished or harassed, particularly if the\\npunishment or harassment is believed to be unfair and undeserved. The very act of being threatened or punished at work can be very\\nstressful. If organizations take steps to eliminate company policies that are perceived to be threatening or punitive, a major source of work\\nstress will also be eliminated. Training supervisors to minimize the use of punishment as a managerial technique will also help control this\\ncommon source of stress.\\nRemove hazardous or dangerous work conditions\\n—In some occupations stress results from exposure to hazardous work conditions, such as\\nmechanical danger of loss of limb or life, health-harming chemicals, excessive fatigue, or extreme temperatures. The elimination or reduction\\nof these situations is another way of coping with organizational stress.\\nProvide a supportive, team-oriented work environment\\n—There is considerable research evidence that having supportive colleagues—people\\nwho can help deal with stressful work situations—can help reduce worker stress (Fenlason & Beehr, 1994; House, 1981; Lim, 1996). This is\\nparticularly true for workers involved in the emotional labor of service work (Korczynski, 2003). Meta-analyses suggest that social support in\\nthe workplace reduces perceptions of threat, lessens the perceived strength of the stressors, and helps in coping with work-related stress\\n(Viswesvaran, Sanchez, & Fisher, 1999). The more organizations can foster good interpersonal relationships among coworkers and an\\nintegrated, highly functioning work team, the more likely that workers will be able to provide support for one another in times of stress\\n(Heaney, Price, & Rafferty, 1995; Unden, 1996). We will look at work group processes and teamwork in more depth in \\nChapter 12\\n.\\n \\nClose\\n Stress Levels and Stress Sources of Executives Around the\\nWorld\\nA common stereotype in the U.S. is the highly stressed, top-level business executive (Friedman, Hall, &\\nHarris, 1985). Is this characterization accurate, and if so, are high-level managers in other nations\\nsimilarly stressed? The first question—“Are executives highly stressed?”—does not have an easy answer.\\nFor example, many executives constantly work under such stressful conditions as work overload, high\\nlevels of responsibility, and inter-role conflict (e.g., being required to travel extensively on business,\\nwhich interferes with family and personal commitments). The finding that executives have a higher rate\\nof certain types of ulcers than certain blue-collar workers attests to the existence of executive stress\\n(Hurrell, Murphy, Sauter, & Cooper, 1988). On the other hand, executives have the \\nbenefit of some\\nworking conditions that are believed to moderate stress, such as control over the job.\\nThe answer to the question of whether executives worldwide experience similar stressors is also not\\ncompletely clear. There is some indication, however, that executives in different nations experience\\ndifferent types or sources of stress. For example, executives in less-developed countries such as Nigeria\\nand Egypt seem to experience a great deal of stress due to lack of autonomy, whereas those from more\\ndeveloped countries, such as the U.S., the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Japan, experience\\ngreater stress from work overload (Carayon & Zijlstra, 1999; Cooper & Hensman, 1985). Workers in India\\nrated lack of job structure, not workload, as their greatest source of stress (Narayanan, Menon, & Spector,\\n1999). One study found that executives in New Zealand experience less job-related stress than executives\\nin nine other countries (McCormick & Cooper, 1988). These researchers mention that this may be due to\\nthe more relaxed lifestyle in New Zealand and the fact that many of these executives worked for rather\\nsmall organizations.\\nAn interesting study by Kirkcaldy and Cooper (1993) found some evidence that work stress for\\nexecutives may be modified by preference for leisure activities—and that preferred leisure activities may\\nbe related to culture. For example, managers from Germany, who tend to prefer nonaggressive leisure\\nactivities, experienced less job stress than British managers, who typically prefer aggressive leisure\\nactivities.\\nOverall, such studies seem to indicate that although executive job stress is universal, the amount of\\nstress experienced, and the sources of the stress, may vary depending on country or culture.\\nImprove communication\\n—Much of the stress at work derives from difficulties in interpersonal relations with supervisors and coworkers. The\\nbetter the communication among workers, the lower the stress created because of misunderstandings. In addition, stress occurs when workers\\nfeel cut off from or uninformed about organizational processes and operations. In one study, merely providing more job-related information\\nhelped in reducing stress caused by task overload (Jimmieson & Terry, 1999). Proper organizational communication, which will be examined\\nin \\nChapter 11\\n, can prevent workers from experiencing stress from job uncertainty and feelings of isolation.\\n273', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 272}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Negative Employee Attitudes and Behaviors\\nIn \\nChapter 9\\n we saw how individual differences in positive affectivity had a favorable impact on job\\nsatisfaction and other work outcomes and that workers with negative affectivity tended to have low levels of\\nsatisfaction (Connolly & Viswesvaran, 2000). What are the relationships between negative affectivity, worker\\nstress, and undesirable work outcomes? There is mixed evidence about how negative affectivity influences\\nperceived stress; however, it seems that individuals prone to negative emotions do indeed perceive that they\\nhave more stress on their jobs (Cassar & Tattersall, 1998; Spector, Chen, & O’Connell, 2000). However, the true\\nrelationship may be complex. For example, there is evidence that negative affectivity interacts with other\\nvariables, such as perceptions of being treated inequitably or unjustly—with persons prone toward negative\\nemotionality reacting more strongly to being treated unfairly (Aquino, Lewis, & Bradfield, 1999). Workers with\\nhigh negative affectivity were also more likely to leave work early, before the scheduled end of the workday\\n(Iverson & Deery, 2001).

I/O psychologists have investigated \\ncounterproductive work behaviors (CWBs),\\n which are\\ndeviant behaviors that are harmful to an employee’s organization and the organization’s members (Bennett &\\nRobinson, 2000; Spector & Fox, 2005). Counterproductive work behaviors include such things as stealing from\\nemployers, vandalism, sabotage, harassment of coworkers, deliberately missing work, and using drugs or\\nalcohol on the job (see \\nTable 10.5\\n and \\nFigure 10.5\\n).\\nCounterproductive Work Behaviors (CWBs)\\n deviant, negative behaviors that are harmful to an\\norganization and its workers\\nResearch has shown that CWBs can result from stress, frustration at work, feelings of inequity, or even from\\njealousy, which cause attempts to retaliate against the employer and seek revenge (Aquino, Tripp, & Bies, 2001;\\nJensen, Opland, & Ryan, 2010; Meier & Spector, 2013; Shoss, Jundt, Kobler, & Reynolds, 2016). Meta-analyses\\nsuggest that CWBs are more prevalent in younger employees and those with lower job satisfaction (Lau, Au, &\\nHo, 2003). Counterproductive work behaviors, and even workplace aggression and violence, are also linked to\\ntrait negative affectivity, anger, and other personality variables (Douglas & Martinko, 2001; Spector, 1997b).\\nInterestingly, a meta-analysis showed that the incidence of CWBs is negatively related to (\\nr\\n = −0.32) the\\nincidence of organizational citizenship behaviors (Dalal, 2005), but they are distinct constructs (Spector, Bauer,\\n& Fox, 2010).\\nTable 10.5\\n \\nExamples of Counterproductive Work Behaviors (CWBs)\\nSaid something hurtful to or made fun of a coworker\\nActed rudely or publicly embarrassed a coworker\\nTaken property from work without permission\\nFalsified a receipt to get reimbursed for more than you spent on a business expense\\n274', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 273}),\n",

(We will discuss group\\nlevel influences on behavior fully in \\nChapter 12\\n). Also, making sure that employees are treated fairly, providing\\nreasonable workloads, clearly defining jobs, and having supervisors trained to mediate interpersonal disputes\\namong workers are other strategies to prevent counterproductive behavior and workplace violence (Atwater &\\nElkins, 2009; Spector, 2001).\\nAlcohol and Drug Use in the Workplace\\nA problem that is of great concern to businesses and to industrial/organizational psychologists is an employee’s\\nuse and abuse of alcohol and drugs (Frone, 2011). No doubt a certain percentage of industrial accidents occur\\nbecause of worker \\nintoxication. The combination of alcohol or drugs and heavy machinery or motor vehicles\\ncan be deadly. Drug and alcohol abuse can also be responsible for decreased productivity and increased\\nabsenteeism and turnover, not to mention all the problems that it can cause in the home lives of workers. The\\ncosts of all of this are staggering. A conservative estimate is that substance abuse costs U.S. employers about\\n$81 billion dollars a year, and substance abuse is a worldwide problem (National Council on Alcoholism and\\nDrug Dependence, 2014).\\nA study of young workers found that workers who reported problems with alcohol and drugs had greater\\njob instability and reduced job satisfaction in comparison to their peers who did not abuse drugs (Galaif,\\nNewcomb, & Carmona, 2001). Moreover, this is likely a cyclical process. Studies suggest that workers who are\\nunder severe stress, such as heavy job demands or the stress of job loss, may turn to alcohol or drugs (Begley,\\n1998; Frone, 2008; Murphy, Beaton, Pike, & Johnson, 1999). This, in turn, leads to problems on the job, and the\\ncycle continues.\\n275', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 274}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='There is some evidence that organizational policies that ban substance abuse in the workplace and advocate\\nagainst illicit drug use reduce employees’ use of drugs both on and off the job (Carpenter, 2007). A number of\\nprograms have been used to try to deter drug use by employees (Ghodse, 2005).\\nIn an effort to combat substance abuse, many companies have \\nemployee assistance programs (EAPs),\\nprograms that offer counseling for a variety of employee problems. Of particular concern is counseling for drug\\nand alcohol abuse, although EAPs also help employees deal with work stress and personal problems that may\\nadversely affect their performance and well-being (Cairo, 1983; Cooper, Dewe, & O’Driscoll, 2011). Although\\nemployee counseling has long been offered by companies, only in the past 20 years have comprehensive EAPs\\nbecome commonplace in large organizations. This increase is likely due to the growing concern over the\\ndevastating consequences of substance abuse in terms of harming worker health and organizational\\nproductivity. The majority of large American companies today have some type of formalized employee\\nassistance program.\\nEmployee Assistance Programs (EAPs)\\n counseling provided for a variety of worker problems,\\nparticularly drug and alcohol abuse\\nAlthough I/O psychologists are greatly concerned about the negative impact of substance abuse and work\\nstress on employee productivity and well-being, clinical and counseling psychologists, social workers, and drug\\nrehabilitation counselors, rather than I/O psychologists, typically staff EAPs. However, I/O psychologists may\\nhave a hand in the design, implementation, and evaluation of EAPs.\\nEmployee assistance programs usually take one of two forms. External programs are those in which the\\ncompany contracts with an outside agency to provide counseling services for its employees. Internal EAPs offer\\nservices at the work site. The advantage of an internal program is its convenience for the employees, although\\nthey are expensive to maintain. Usually only large organizations can afford internal EAPs. The main\\nadvantages of external programs are the lower costs and the increased employee confidentiality.\\nDespite the increasing popularity of employee assistance programs, there has been surprisingly little\\nresearch on their effectiveness (Weiss, 1987; Kirk & Brown, 2003). The problem results partly from the\\ndifficulty of evaluating any counseling program, because it is not always clear which variables will best\\ndetermine a program’s “success” \\n(Mio & Goishi, 1988). For example, some programs measure success by the\\nnumber of workers treated, whereas others may use some standard of recovery or “cure.” Furthermore, it is\\ndifficult to determine how EAP counseling affects bottom-line variables such as employee performance. It is\\nalso difficult to determine the effectiveness of EAPs because the large number of external agencies that offer\\ncounseling services for businesses usually conduct their own evaluations, and it is unclear how objective and\\naccurate these self-assessments are. Although there are questions about the effectiveness of employee\\nassistance programs in general, it is likely that even a few cases of employee recovery would lead an employer\\nto label an EAP a success because of the severity of drug and alcohol addiction. Moreover, there is some\\nevidence that EAPs do help reduce long-term health care costs for employees (Cummings & Follette, 1976).\\nOne critic of substance abuse EAPs argues that they focus primarily on treating alcohol and drug problems\\nafter they have reached the problem stage, but give little attention to their prevention (Nathan, 1983). Despite\\nthe uncertainty of the effectiveness of employee assistance programs, it is likely that they will become a\\nmainstay in most work organizations and another service that will be considered an essential part of any\\nemployee benefit package.\\nStop \\n&\\n Review\\nGive five examples of counterproductive work behaviors.\\n276', metadata={'source': 'pdf/Ronald_E_Riggio_Introduction_to_Industrial_Orga.pdf', 'page': 275}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Summary\\nAlthough there is a great deal of disagreement over definitions of stress, \\nworker stress\\n can be defined as\\nphysiological or psychological reactions to an event that is perceived to be threatening or taxing. Stress is\\nactually a perception, so there is tremendous individual variation in what one perceives to be stressful.\\nNegative stress, or distress, can cause stress-related illness, and it can affect absenteeism, turnover, and work\\nperformance.\\nCertain occupations, such as air traffic controller and health care provider, are stereotypically associated\\nwith high levels of stress. Worker stress can also come from either organizational sources or individual sources,\\nwhich are commonly classified as \\nsituational\\n or \\ndispositional sources\\n, respectively. Organizational sources may\\ninclude having too much to do—\\nwork overload\\n—or too little to do—\\nunderutilization\\n. \\nJob ambiguity\\n, which\\noccurs when job tasks and responsibilities are not clearly defined or from inadequate performance feedback or\\njob insecurity, and \\ninterpersonal stress\\n, which arises from relations with coworkers, are other organizational\\nsources of stress, as are workers’ sense of a \\nlack of control\\n over their jobs, \\norganizational change\\n, and \\nwork–\\nfamily conflict\\n. Individual sources of work stress include the worker’s experience of traumatic \\nlife events\\n;\\nsusceptibility to stress, such as the lack of \\nhardiness\\n, or resistance to stress-related illnesses; and certain\\npersonality characteristics such as the \\nType A behavior pattern\\n, which is the coronary-prone personality.\\nAttempts to measure stress have included physiological measures, self-report assessments, the measurement\\nof stressful life events, and the match between worker characteristics and the demands of the work situation,\\nreferred to as the \\nperson–environment fit\\n approach. Stress has been shown to be related to certain physical\\nillnesses such as ulcers, high blood pressure, and heart disease. These stress-related \\nillnesses as well as stress\\nitself are tied to rates of employee absenteeism and turnover and to job performance, although the relationship\\nbetween stress and performance is complex. Long-term stress can lead to \\njob burnout\\n, a multidimensional\\nconstruct that relates to one’s tendency to withdraw from work.\\nStrategies for coping with work stress can be divided into \\nindividual coping strategies\\n and \\norganizational\\ncoping strategies\\n. Individual strategies include programs of exercise, diet, systematic relaxation training,\\nmeditation, biofeedback, time management, work planning, and cognitive coping strategies. Organizational\\nstrategies include improving the person–job fit, offering better training and orientation programs, giving\\nworkers a sense of control over their jobs, eliminating punitive management styles, removing hazardous work\\nconditions, and improving organizational communication.\\nCounterproductive work behaviors\\n, which can result from stress, frustration, or feelings of inequity or can be\\ndue to personality differences, such as trait negative affectivity, are destructive behaviors designed to harm\\nemployers or fellow employees. An important concern of management is reducing counterproductive work\\nbehaviors and dealing with alcohol and drug use in the workplace. One strategy is to offer \\nemployee assistance\\nprograms\\n to help workers deal with alcohol and drug problems, as well as personal issues and workplace stress.\\nStudy Questions and Exercises\\n1\\n. \\nList the sources of stress in your own life. Ask a friend to do the same. Are there implications for\\ndefining and understanding important differences in your two lists, or are they quite similar? What\\nare the implications for defining and understanding stress?\\n2\\n. \\nConsider how the work world will be changing in the next several years. What are the implications\\nfor worker stress? Will there be more of it or less? What are some sources of technology-related stress\\n(technostress) addressed in “On the Cutting Edge” that will increase in the future?\\n3\\n. \\nConsider the various means of assessing stress. Which seems most accurate and why?\\n4\\n. \\nBased on the material in the chapter, design a stress management program for use in an organization.\\n5\\n. \\nWhat are the connections between worker stress and counterproductive work behaviors?

      "As has been stated, the stress response involves physiological reactions as well as psychological and emotional\n",

      "and strain that accompany stress. This includes blood pressure monitoring, electrocardiogram (EKG) for\n",
      "monitoring heart rate, or blood tests for monitoring levels of certain hormones, such as the stress-linked\n",
      "hormone, cortisol, and cholesterol in the bloodstream. One problem with using such physiological indicators of\n",
      "stress is the amount of variation that can occur from hour to hour, day to day, or person to person (Herd, 1988).\n",

      "major categories: reports about organizational conditions or reports about psychological and/or physical states.\n",
      "Reports on organizational conditions typically contain items that ask about facets of the job such as\n",
      "autonomy, feedback, task identity, task significance, skill variety, complexity, dealing with others, ambiguity,\n",

      "there is a great sense of pressure. It is sometimes hard to drag yourself out of bed in the morning. Some of this\n",
      "is due to the increasing workload, but you are also having trouble getting along with a particularly difficult\n",
      "coworker. Sometimes, the pressure from work makes it hard to concentrate; other times you feel sick and\n",

      "As we saw in \n",
      "Chapter 9\n",

      "Situational stress\n",
      " can come from all aspects of our lives. We are subjected\n",

      "we encounter at work. No doubt, all these various sources of stress accumulate and add to our overall stress\n",
      "levels. That is, stress at home can spill over to work situations and vice versa. Most stress researchers realize\n",
      "this and emphasize that when studying stress, it is important to look at the broad picture of an individual’s\n",
      "total stress, rather than focusing narrowly on stress derived from work (Erickson, Nichols, & Ritter, 2000;\n",

      " stress arising from certain conditions that exist in the work environment or in the\n",

      "autonomy, feedback, task identity, task significance, skill variety, complexity, dealing with others, ambiguity,\n",
      "and workload (Spector, 1992). For example, questions dealing with workload might include the following\n",

      "must focus on performance-related behaviors rather than on performance-related personality traits or other\n",
      "dispositional variables, and that appraisals must be reviewed with the employees (Barrett & Kernan, 1987; Feild\n",

      "employment contract,” such as promises made by an employer. For example, before deregulation of provision\n",
      "of utilities (e.g., electricity), many utility employees were led to believe that they had “lifetime employment”\n",
      "because workers were rarely fired or laid off. However, in the more competitive post-deregulation\n",
      "environment, utility companies needed to downsize, causing many of the laid-off workers to seek legal\n",

      "The increase in team-based work groups has important implications for the use of performance appraisals. It\n",

      "Jenkins, & Walker, 1998; Wildman, Bedwell, Salas, & Smith-Jentsch, 2011). One model suggests that a good\n",

      "The shift toward team approaches, as well as the fact that the nature and structure of many jobs change\n",

      "Describe nine purposes of performance appraisals.\n",
      "As mentioned, it is often difficult, if not impossible, to obtain objective performance criteria for certain jobs,\n",
      "such as graphic artist, software developer, and executive vice president. Jobs such as these may best be assessed\n",
      "through ratings or judgments. Another drawback of objective assessments is that they may focus too much on\n",
      "specific, quantifiable outcomes. Because many jobs are complex, looking at only one or two objective measures\n",
      "of performance may not capture the total picture of performance. Some aspects of job performance such as\n",
      "work quality, worker initiative, and work effort are difficult to assess objectively. For example, a salesperson\n",
      "might have high dollar sales figures, but may be so pushy and manipulative that customers are unlikely to\n",
      "return to the store. Likewise, a research analyst may have relatively low output rates because he spends a great\n",
      "deal of time teaching new workers valuable work techniques and helping coworkers solve problems. It is\n",
      "important to emphasize that comprehensive evaluation of employee performance might include \n",
      "both very\n",
      "positive, outside-of-the-job-description activities, such as helping other workers, and counterproductive\n",
      "behaviors, such as “goofing off,” substance abuse on the job, or disrupting the work team (Viswesvaran &\n",
      "Ones, 2000).\n",
      "In many cases, collecting objective performance data is time consuming and costly (although see “On the\n",
      "Cutting Edge”). By contrast, subjective performance criteria are usually easy and relatively inexpensive to\n",
      "obtain and thus may be the preferred method of assessment for many organizations. Moreover, subjective\n",

      "motivation or “team spirit.”\n",
      "Regardless of the criteria used to evaluate performance of a job, a number of important criterion concerns or\n",
      "issues have implications for conducting accurate performance appraisals (Bernardin & Beatty, 1984). A primary\n",

      ": the notion that the means of appraising performance is indeed pertinent\n",
      "to job success, as identified in the job analysis. A performance appraisal should cover only the specific KSAOs\n",
      "needed to perform a job successfully. For example, the performance criteria for a bookkeeper should deal with\n",
      "knowledge of accounting procedures, mathematical skills, and producing work that is neat and error free, not\n",
      "with personal appearance or oral communication skills—factors that are clearly not relevant to the effective\n",
